      <p>
        This specification defines a JSON-based file format that provides
        developers with a centralized place to put metadata associated with a
        web application. This metadata includes, but is not limited to, the web
        application's name, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL to
        open when a user launches the web application. The manifest also allows
        developers to declare a default screen orientation for their web
        application, as well as providing the ability to set the display mode
        for the application (e.g., in fullscreen). Additionally, the manifest
        allows a developer to "scope" a web application to a URL. This
        restricts the URLs to which the manifest is applied and provides a
        means to "deep link" into a web application from other applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this metadata, user agents can provide developers with means to
        create user experiences that are more comparable to that of a native
        application.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification also defines the `manifest` link type as a
        declarative means to associate a document with a manifest.

      <h2>
        Installable web applications
      </h2>
      <p>
        A common use case of a manifest is for a user agent to
        <dfn data-local-lt="installing|installation" data-lt=
        "installed">install</dfn> a web application; whereby the user agent
        provides the end-user with a means of instantiating a new <a>top-level
        browsing context</a> that has the manifest's members <a>applied</a> to
        it. A web application that is installed is known as a <dfn data-export=
        "">installed web application</dfn>. That is, the manifest's members, or
        their defaults, are in effect on the <a>top-level browsing context</a>.
        This distinguishes an installed web application from a traditional
        bookmark, as opening a web page from a traditional bookmark will not
        have the manifest's properties <a>applied</a> to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, on user agents that support installation, a web
        application could be presented and launched in a way that, to the
        end-user, is indistinguishable from native applications: such as
        appearing as a labeled icon on the home screen, launcher, or start
        menu. When launched, the manifest is <a>applied</a> by the user agent
        to the <a>top-level browsing context</a> prior to the <a>start URL</a>
        being loaded. This gives the user agent an opportunity to apply the
        relevant values of the manifest, possibly changing the <a>display
        mode</a> and screen orientation of the web application. Alternatively,
        and again as an example, the user agent could <a>install</a> the web
        application into a list of bookmarks within the user agent itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        A [=document=] may either be <dfn>installable</dfn> or not. The initial
        state of a document is not <a>installable</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At any time, the user agent MAY perform the <dfn>steps to determine
        installability of the document</dfn>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Let <var>manifest</var> and <var>manifest URL</var> be the result
        of <a>obtaining the manifest</a>.
        </li>
        <li>If <a>obtaining the manifest</a> results in an error, the user
        agent MAY either:
          <ul>
            <li>Fall back to using the <a>top-level browsing context</a>
            {{Document}}'s metadata to populate <var>manifest</var> in a
            user-agent-specific way (e.g., setting
            |manifest|.{{WebAppManifest/name}} to the document [^title^] and
            considering the document <a>installable</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Or, consider the document not <a>installable</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Otherwise, at its discretion, the user agent MAY consider the
        {{Document}} <a>installable</a> (see [[[#installability-signals]]]).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Authority of the manifest's metadata
        </h3>
        <p>
          When a <a>manifest</a> is linked from a {{Document}}, it indicates to
          the user agent that the metadata is <dfn>authoritative</dfn>: that
          is, the user agent SHOULD use the metadata of the manifest instead of
          the one in the {{Document}}. However, in cases where metadata is
          missing, or in error, a user agent MAY fallback to the {{Document}}
          to find suitable replacements for missing manifest members (e.g.,
          using `application-name` in place of `short_name`).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section data-link-for="WebAppManifest">
        <h3>
          Application's name
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>application's name</dfn> is derived from either the
          <a>name</a> member or <a>short_name</a> member (if either is present)
          - otherwise, it is generated by the user agent or provided by the
          end-user.
        </p>
        <p>
          When either member is missing from the manifest, a user agent MAY use
          the <a>name</a> member as a fallback for the <a>short_name</a> member
          or vice versa.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the <a>name</a> and <a>short_name</a> members are undefined, the
          user agent SHOULD assign a default name (e.g., "Untitled") that
          follows platform conventions. Alternatively, a user agent MAY allow
          the end-user to input some text that can serve as the
          <a>application's name</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When both the <a>name</a> and <a>short_name</a> members are present,
          it is left up to implementations to decide which member is best
          suited for the space available (e.g., the <a>short_name</a> member
          might be better suited for the space available underneath an icon).

          Privacy and security considerations

        <p>
          It is RECOMMENDED that UI that affords the end user the ability to
          <a>install</a> a web application also allows inspecting the icon,
          name, <a>start URL</a>, origin, etc. pertaining to a web application.
          This is to give an end-user an opportunity to make a conscious
          decision to approve, and possibly modify, the information pertaining
          to the web application before installing it. This also gives the
          end-user an opportunity to discern if the web application is spoofing
          another web application, by, for example, using an unexpected icon or
          name.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is RECOMMENDED that user agents prevent other applications from
          determining which applications are installed on the system (e.g., via
          a timing attack on the user agent's cache). This could be done by,
          for example, invalidating from the user agent's cache the resources
          linked to from the manifest (for example, icons) after a web
          application is <a>installed</a> - or by using an entirely different
          cache from that used for regular web browsing.

          Installability signals
        </h3>
        <p>
          By design, this specification does not provide developers with an
          explicit API to "install" a web application. Instead, a
          <a>manifest</a> can serve as an <dfn>installability signal</dfn> to a
          user agent that a web application can be <a>installed</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples of <a>installability signals</a> for a web application:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>is <a>associated with a manifest</a> with at least a
          <code>name</code> member and a suitable icon.
          </li>
          <li>is served over a secure network connection.
          </li>
          <li>has a sensible content security policy.
          </li>
          <li>is able to responsively adapt to display on a variety of screen
          sizes, catering for both mobile and desktop.
          </li>
          <li>is able to function without a network connection.
          </li>
          <li>is repeatedly used by the end-user over some extended period of
          time.
          </li>
          <li>has been explicitly marked by the user as one that they value and
          trust (e.g., by bookmarking or "starring" it).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This list is not exhaustive and some <a>installability signals</a>
          might not apply to all user agents. How a user agent makes use of
          these <a>installability signals</a> to determine if a web application
          can be <a>installed</a> is left to implementers.

          Uninstallation

        <p>
          User agents SHOULD provide a mechanism for the user to remove an
          <a>installed web application</a> application.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is RECOMMENDED that at the time of removal, the user agent also
          present the user with an opportunity to revoke other persistent data

          persistent storage.

        The <dfn data-dfn-for="manifest" data-lt="navigation scope"
        data-export="">navigation scope of a manifest</dfn> is the
        {{WebAppManifest/scope}} member of a [=processed manifest=]. The
        navigation scope restricts the set of URLs to which an [=application

      <div class="note" data-link-for="WebAppManifest">
        <p>
          If the <a>scope</a> member is not present in the manifest, it
          defaults to the parent path of the <a>start_url</a> member. For
          example, if <a>start_url</a> is <code>/pages/welcome.html</code>, and
          <a>scope</a> is missing, the navigation scope will be
          <code>/pages/</code> on the same origin. If <a>start_url</a> is

          navigation scope will be <code>/pages/</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developers should take care, if they rely on the default behavior,
          that all of the application's page URLs begin with the parent path of

        differ from any UI used when the [=Document/URL=] is [=manifest/within

        <p>
          The above recommendation (to show some UI when the <a>application
          context</a> is navigated to an out-of-scope <a>URL</a>) is for
          security reasons. It ensures that users are always aware of which
          <a>origin</a> they are interacting with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite this, there is still a potential spoofing risk, if an
          installed app pretends to navigate to an out-of-scope site on another
          <a>origin</a>. The site shows a fake version of the user agent's
          prominent out-of-scope UI, indicating to the user that it is on
          another origin. However, in reality, the user has never navigated
          away from the installed app's origin, and the user agent is not
          showing any out-of-scope UI. User agents could try to show the
          out-of-scope UI in a way that cannot be spoofed by the installed app.
          However, due to the nature of the user agent's UI being minimal or
          non-existent for installed apps, this may not be possible.

          A <dfn>deep link</dfn> is a URL that is [=manifest/within scope=] of

        </p>
        <p>
          An <a>application context</a> can be instantiated through a <a>deep

        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <p>
            The concept of a <a>deep link</a> is useful in that it allows
            hyperlinking from one <a>installed web application</a> to another.
            This can be from a native application to an <a>installed web
            application</a> (and possibly vice versa!). Theoretically, this can
            provide seamless context switching between native and web
            applications through standard hyperlinks. And in the case where a
            particular web application is not <a>installed</a>, the OS can just
            open the link in the user's preferred web browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            Implementers are encouraged make such context switching obvious to
            the user, for example, by adhering to the human interface
            guidelines of the underlying platform with respect to application
            switching.

      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>display mode</dfn> represents how the web application is being
        presented within the context of an OS (e.g., in fullscreen, etc.).
        Display modes correspond to user interface (UI) metaphors and
        functionality in use on a given platform. The UI conventions of the
        display modes are purely advisory and implementers are free to
        interpret them how they best see fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a user agent applies a particular <a>display mode</a> to an
        <a>application context</a>, it becomes the <dfn>default display
        mode</dfn> for the <a>top-level browsing context</a> (i.e., it is used
        as the display mode when the window is <a>navigated</a>). The user
        agent MAY override the <a>default display mode</a> for security reasons
        (e.g., the <a>top-level browsing context</a> is <a>navigated</a> to
        another origin) and/or the user agent MAY provide the user with a means
        of switching to another <a>display mode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the <a data-link-for="WebAppManifest">display</a> member is
        missing, or if there is no valid <a data-link-for=
        "WebAppManifest">display</a> member, the user agent uses the
        <a>browser</a> <a>display mode</a> as the <a>default display mode</a>.
        As such, the user agent MUST support the <a>browser</a> <a>display
        mode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <a>display mode</a>, except <code>browser</code>, has a
        <dfn>fallback display mode</dfn>, which is the <a>display mode</a> that
        the user agent can try to use if it doesn't support a particular
        <a>display mode</a>. If the user agent does support a <a>fallback
        display mode</a>, then it checks to see if it can use that <a>display
        mode</a>'s <a>fallback display mode</a>. This creates a fallback chain,
        with the <a>default display mode</a> (<code>browser</code>) being the
        last item in the chain.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>
          For example, SuperSecure Browser (a fictitious browser) only supports
          the <code>minimal-ui</code> and <code>browser</code> display modes,
          but a developer declares that she wants <code>fullscreen</code> in
          the manifest. In this case, the user agent will first check if it
          supports <code>fullscreen</code> (it doesn't), so it falls back to
          <code>standalone</code> (which it also doesn't support), and
          ultimately falls back to <code>minimal-ui</code>.

        The <dfn>display modes values</dfn> defined by

          the entirety of the available display area.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          The <a>fallback display mode</a> for <code>fullscreen</code> is

        <dt>
          <dfn>standalone</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Opens the web application to look and feel like a standalone native
          application. This can include the application having a different
          window, its own icon in the application launcher, etc. In this mode,
          the user agent will exclude standard browser UI elements such as an
          URL bar, but can include other system UI elements such as a status
          bar and/or system back button.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          The <a>fallback display mode</a> for <code>standalone</code> is

          This mode is similar to <a>standalone</a>, but provides the end-user

          controlling navigation (i.e., back, forward, reload, and perhaps some
          way of viewing the document's address). A user agent can include
          other platform specific UI elements, such as "share" and "print"
          buttons or whatever is customary on the platform and user agent.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          The <a>fallback display mode</a> for <code>minimal-ui</code> is

          <dfn>browser</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Opens the web application using the platform-specific convention for
          opening hyperlinks in the user agent (e.g., in a browser tab or a new
          window).
        </dd>
        <dd>
          The <code>browser</code> <a>display mode</a> doesn't have a

      <p class="note">
        The <a>fullscreen</a> <a>display mode</a> is orthogonal to, and works

        while the [[FULLSCREEN]] API operates on an element contained within

          Privacy and security considerations
        </h3>
        <p>
          When the web application is running, it is RECOMMENDED that the user
          agent provides the end-user a means to access common information
          about the web application, such as the origin, start and/or current
          URL, granted permissions, and associated icon. How such information
          is exposed to end-users is left up to implementers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, when applying a manifest that sets the <a>display
          mode</a> to anything except "<a>browser</a>", it is RECOMMENDED that
          the user agent clearly indicate to the end-user that their are
          leaving the normal browsing context of a web browser. Ideally,
          launching or switching to a web application is performed in a manner
          that is consistent with launching or switching to other applications
          in the host platform. For example, a long and obvious animated
          transition, or speaking the text "Launching application X".

          The <code>'display-mode'</code> media feature
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <code><dfn>display-mode</dfn></code> media feature represents,
          via a CSS media query [[MEDIAQ]], the <a>display mode</a> of the web
          application. This media feature applies to the top-level browsing
          context and any child browsing contexts. Child browsing contexts
          reflect the <a>display mode</a> of the <a>top-level browsing
          context</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent MUST expose the '<code>display-mode</code>' media
          feature irrespective of whether a manifest is being applied to a
          browsing context. For example, if the end-user puts the whole user
          agent into fullscreen, then the user agent would reflect this change
          to CSS and scripts via the '<code>display-mode</code>' media feature.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <p>
            Please note that the <code>fullscreen</code> <a>display mode</a> is
            not directly related to the CSS <code>:fullscreen</code>
            pseudo-class specified in the [[[FULLSCREEN]]]. The
            <code>:fullscreen</code> pseudo-class matches exclusively when a
            [[HTML]] element is put into the fullscreen element stack. However,
            a side effect of calling the <code>requestFullscreen()</code>
            method on an element using the [[FULLSCREEN]] API is that the
            browser window can enter a fullscreen mode at the OS-level. In such
            a case, both <code>:fullscreen</code> and <code>(display-mode:
            fullscreen)</code> will match.
          </p>
          <p>
            On some platforms, it is possible for a user to put a browser
            window into fullscreen without the aid of the [[[FULLSCREEN]]].
            When this happens, the <code>:fullscreen</code> pseudo class will
            not match, but <code>(display-mode: fullscreen)</code> will match.
            This is exemplified in CSS code below.

        <p>
          A <dfn>language tag</dfn> is a <a>string</a> that matches the

          Language Subtag Registry</a> for an authoritative list of possible
          values). That is, a language range is composed of one or more
          <dfn>subtags</dfn> that are delimited by a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS ("-").
          For example, the '<code>en-AU</code>' language range represents
          English as spoken in Australia, and '<code>fr-CA</code>' represents
          French as spoken in Canada. Language tags that meet the validity
          criteria of [[RFC5646]] section 2.2.9 that can be verified without

          The steps for <dfn>processing the <code>lang</code> member</dfn> is

        <p>
          The <dfn>icons</dfn> member are images that serve as iconic
          representations of the web application in various contexts. For
          example, they can be used to represent the web application amongst a
          list of other applications, or to integrate the web application with
          an <abbr title="operating system">OS</abbr>'s task switcher and/or
          system preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there are multiple equally appropriate images in
          {{WebAppManifest/icons}}, a user agent MUST use the last one declared
          in order at the time that the user agent collected the list of
          {{WebAppManifest/icons}}. If the user agent tries to use an icon but
          that icon is determined, upon closer examination, to in fact be
          inappropriate (e.g. because its content type is unsupported), then
          the user agent MUST try the next-most-appropriate icon as determined
          by examining the {{ManifestImageResource}}'s members.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>
            In the following example, the developer has made the following
            choices about the icons associated with the web application:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The developer has included two icons at the same size, but in
            two different formats. One is explicitly marked as WebP through the
            <code>type</code> member. If the user agent doesn't support WebP,
            it falls back to the second icon of the same size. The <a>MIME
            type</a> of this icon can then be either determined via a HTTP
            header, or can be <a data-lt="computed mime type">sniffed</a> by
            the user agent once the first few bytes of the icon are received.
            </li>
            <li>The developer wants to use an SVG for greater than or equal to
            257x257px. She has found that the SVG file looks too blurry at
            small sizes, even on high-density screens. To deal with this
            problem, she's included an SVG icon that is only used when the
            dimensions are at least 257px. Otherwise, the user agent uses the
            ICO file (hd_hi.ico), which includes a gamut of raster icons
            individually tailored for small display sizes.

          the {{OrientationLockType}} enum defined in [[SCREEN-ORIENTATION]].

        <p>
          If the user agent honors the value of the <a>orientation</a> member

          <a>default screen orientation</a> for the life of the web application
          (unless overridden by some other means at runtime). This means that
          the user agent MUST return the orientation to the <a>default screen

          <a>navigated</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the specification relies on the [[SCREEN-ORIENTATION]]'s
          {{OrientationLockType}}, it is OPTIONAL for a user agent to implement
          the [[SCREEN-ORIENTATION]] API. Supporting the [[SCREEN-ORIENTATION]]
          API is, of course, RECOMMENDED.
        </p>
        <p>
          Certain UI/UX concerns and/or platform conventions will mean that
          some screen orientations and display modes <dfn>cannot be used
          together</dfn>. Which orientations and display modes cannot be used
          together is left to the discretion of implementers. For example, for

          screen orientation</a> of an application while in

          </h3>
          <p>
            It's conceivable that the <a>start_url</a> could be crafted to
            indicate that the application was launched from outside the browser
            (e.g., <code>"start_url": "index.html?launcher=homescreen"</code>).
            This can be useful for analytics and possibly other customizations.
            However, it is also conceivable that developers could encode
            strings into the start_url that uniquely identify the user (e.g., a
            server assigned <abbr>UUID</abbr>). This is fingerprinting/privacy
            sensitive information that the user might not be aware of.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the above, it is RECOMMENDED that, upon installation, or any
            time thereafter, a user agent allows the user to inspect and, if
            necessary, modify the <a>start URL</a> of an application.

        <p>
          A <dfn>related application</dfn> is an application accessible to the
          underlying application platform that has a relationship with the web
          application <a>associated with a manifest</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>related_applications</dfn> member lists <a>related
          applications</a> and serves as an indication of such a relationship
          between web application and <a>related applications</a>. This
          relationship is unidirectional and unless a listed application claims
          the same relationship, the <a>user agent</a> MUST NOT assume a
          bi-directional endorsement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example of usages of the <code>related_applications</code> could be a
          crawler that would use that information to gather more information
          about the web application or a browser that could suggest a listed

        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>background_color</a> member is only meant to improve the user

          categories to which the web application belongs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <a>categories</a> member is only meant as a hint to catalogs or
          stores listing web applications and it is expected that these will
          make a best effort to find appropriate categories (or category) under
          which to list the web application. Like search engines and meta
          keywords, catalogs and stores are not required to honor this hint.
        </p>
        <p>
          The steps for <dfn>processing the <code>categories</code>
          member</dfn> are given by the following algorithm. The algorithm
          takes a sequence&lt;<a>USVString</a>&gt; <var>categories</var> as an
          argument. This algorithm returns an
          <code>Array&lt;USVString&gt;</code>.

        <p>
          The categories <a>string</a> array is case insensitive and converted

          <code>sports</code>, <code>Sports</code>, <code>SPORTS</code>, and

        Each {{ManifestImageResource}} is an image that is conceptually part of
        a web application, suitable to use in various contexts depending on the
        semantics of the member that is using the object (e.g., an icon that is
        part of an application menu, etc.).

      <p>
        User agents MAY modify the images associated with an
        {{ManifestImageResource}} to better match the platformâs visual style
        before displaying it to the user, for example by rounding the corners
        or painting it in a specific color. It is recommended that developers
        prepare their image resources for such scenarios to avoid losing
        important information through, e.g., change of color or clipped
        corners.

        <p>
          When a {{ManifestImageResource}} is used as an <dfn>icon</dfn>, a
          developer can hint that the image is intended to serve some special
          purpose in the context of the host OS (i.e., for better integration).
          User agents SHOULD NOT use an icon other than for its stated <a>icon
          purpose</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          For example, an icon with purpose "<a>monochrome</a>" could be used
          as a badge or pinned icon with a solid fill, visually distinct from
          an application's full color launch icon. The user agent uses the
          value of the {{ManifestImageResource/purpose}} member as a hint to
          determine where and how an {{ManifestImageResource/purpose}} is
          displayed. Unless declared otherwise by the developer, a user agent
          can use an icon for <a>any purpose</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>icon purposes</dfn> are as follows:

            A user agent can present this icon where a <a href=
            "#monochrome-icons-and-solid-fills">monochrome icon with a solid
            fill</a> is needed. The color information in the icon is discarded
            and only the alpha data is used. The icon can then be used by the
            user agent like a mask over any solid fill.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <dfn data-lt="maskable purpose">maskable</dfn>:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The image is designed with <a href="#icon-masks">icon masks and
            safe zone</a> in mind, such that any part of the image that is
            outside the <a>safe zone</a> can safely be ignored and masked away
            by the user agent.
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <dfn data-lt="any purpose">any</dfn>:
          </dt>

            The user agent is free to display the icon in any context.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p class="note">
          If an icon contains multiple purposes, it could be used for any of
          those purposes. If none of the stated purposes are recognized, the
          icon is totally ignored. For example, if an icon has purpose
          <code>"monochrome fizzbuzz"</code>, then it could be used as a
          monochrome icon, as <code>"monochrome"</code> is a valid purpose.
          However, if an icon just has the purpose <code>"fizzbuzz"</code>,
          then it will be ignored.

          Icon masks and safe zone
        </h2>
        <p>
          Some platforms have their own preferred icon shape, but as web
          applications should work across multiple platforms, it is possible to
          indicate that an icon can have a user-agent-specified mask applied by
          adding the <a>maskable</a> purpose. This allows the platform to
          ensure that the icon looks well integrated with the platform, and
          even apply different masks and background colors in different places
          throughout the platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>safe zone</dfn> is the area within a <a>maskable</a> icon
          which is guaranteed to always be visible, regardless of user agent
          preferences. It is defined as a circle with center point in the
          center of the icon and with a radius of 2/5 (40%) of the icon size,
          which means the smaller of the icon width and height, in case the
          icon is not square.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Designers of <a>maskable</a> icons will want to make sure that all
          important parts are within the <a>safe zone</a>.
        </p>

          <figcaption>
            The safe zone is a centrally positioned circle, with radius 2/5
            (40%) of the minimum of the icon's width and height.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          All pixels in this zone are guaranteed to be seen in all masks.
          Pixels outside the safe zone are not guaranteed to (but can) be
          visible depending on the applied mask.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user agent MAY apply a mask of any size, making any pixels that
          are more than 2/5ths of the image size (minimum of width and height
          if non-square) away from the center (the <a>safe zone</a>)
          transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user agent MUST NOT make any pixel within the safe zone
          transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user agent MAY enlarge the icon by adding additional padding.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the icon contains transparent pixels, the user agent MUST
          composite the icon onto a solid fill (e.g., white) of the user
          agent's choice.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          It is suggested that designers avoid using transparent pixels in
          maskable icons.

        <p>
          Some platforms enforce that icons be displayed with a <dfn>solid
          fill</dfn> such as a single color, where only the transparency of the
          icon can be declared in a [=manifest=]. As web applications need to
          work across multiple platforms, it is possible to indicate that an
          icon can have an user-agent-specified color applied by adding the
          <a>monochrome</a> purpose. This allows the platform to ensure that
          the icon looks well integrated with the platform, and even apply
          different colors and padding in different places throughout the
          platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          When processing a <a>monochrome</a> icon, the user agent MUST NOT
          independently display the red component, green component, or blue
          component of a pixel. The user agent SHOULD display each pixel with
          its original alpha value, but with a red, green, and blue value of
          the user agent's choosing. It is RECOMMENDED that the user agent use
          the same color value for all pixels.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Designers of <a>monochrome</a> icons could set all pixels to black
          and only use transparency to create a silhouette of their icon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user agent MAY enlarge the icon by adding additional padding.
        </p>
        <p>
          The user agent MAY add a background of any color behind transparent
          pixels, and SHOULD ensure that the background has sufficient contrast
          with the icon.

            It's conceivable that any {{ShortcutItem/url}} could be crafted to
            indicate that the application was launched from outside the browser
            (e.g., `"url": "/task/?from=homescreen"`). It is also conceivable
            that developers could encode strings into the {{ShortcutItem/url}}
            that uniquely identify the user (e.g., a server assigned
            <abbr>UUID</abbr>). This is fingerprinting/privacy sensitive

            <p>
              This specification does not directly deal with high-value data.
              However, <a>installed web applications</a> and their data could
              be seen as "high value" (particularly from a privacy
              perspective).
            </p>
            <p>
              As the manifest format is JSON and will commonly be encoded using
              [[UNICODE]], the security considerations described in
              [[ECMA-404]] and [[UNICODE-SECURITY]] apply. In addition, because
              there is no way to prevent developers from including
              custom/unrestrained data in a <a>manifest</a>, implementors need
              to impose their own implementation-specific limits on the values
              of otherwise unconstrained member types, e.g. to prevent denial
              of service attacks, to guard against running out of memory, or to
              work around platform-specific limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web applications will generally contain ECMAScript, HTML, CSS
              files, and other media, which are executed in a sand-boxed
              environment. As such, implementors need to be aware of the
              security implications for the types they support. Specifically,
              implementors need to consider the security implications outlined
              in at least the following specifications: [[CSS-MIME]],
              [[ECMAScript-MIME]], [[HTML]].
            </p>
            <p>
              As web applications can contain content that is able to
              simultaneously interact with the local device and a remote host,
              implementors need to consider the privacy implications resulting
              from exposing private information to a remote host. Mitigation
              and in-depth defensive measures are an implementation
              responsibility and not prescribed by this specification. However,
              in designing these measures, implementors are advised to enable
              user awareness of information sharing, and to provide easy access
              to interfaces that enable revocation of permissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              As this specification allows for the declaration of URLs within
              certain members of a manifest, implementors need to consider the
              security considerations discussed in the [[URL]] specification.
              Implementations intending to display <abbr title=
              "Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRIs</abbr> and
              <abbr title="Internationalized domain name">IDNA</abbr> addresses
              found in the manifest are strongly encouraged to follow the
              security advice given in [[UNICODE-SECURITY]].
            </p>
            <p>
              Developers need to be aware of the security considerations
              discussed throughout the [[CSP3]] specification, particularly in
              relation to making <code>data:</code> a valid source for the
              purpose of <q>inlining</q> a manifest. Doing so can enable XSS
              attacks by allowing a manifest to be included directly in the
              document itself; this is best avoided completely.

            Proprietary manifest members

          <p>
            Although proprietary extensions are undesirable, they can't
            realistically be avoided. As such, the RECOMMENDED way to add a new
            proprietary manifest member as an extension is to use a vendor
            prefix.
          </p>
          <p>
            We encourage implementors to add proprietary extensions to our

            Registry</a>. This allows the community to track what extensions
            vendors and/or the web community have defined and documented.
            Periodically, we will consider those extensions for
            standardization.

      <h2>
        Relationship to HTML's <code>link</code> and <code>meta</code> elements
      </h2>
      <p>
        An extensive discussion of why we chose to use JSON instead of HTML
        <code>meta</code>/<code>link</code> tags for this specification is
        available on <a href=
        "https://github.com/w3c/manifest/issues/97">GitHub</a> and on the
        <a href=
        "https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2014Jan/0139.html">www-tag</a>
        list. Below is a short summary of the key points raised in those
        discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The document format defined in this specification provides a unified
        means of encapsulating metadata about a Web application in a way that
        we hope will avoid existing pitfalls with both proprietary and
        [[HTML]]'s <code>meta</code>/<code>link</code> tags. Those pitfalls
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developers have to duplicate the icons and application name in each
        page of a web site, leading to significant redundancy across pages.
        This is compounded if that information never gets used by the user
        agent (e.g., the user never bookmarks the web application).
        </li>
        <li>Spreading metadata across multiple documents can cause data to fall
        out of sync.
        </li>
        <li>If the metadata for a web application lives in a HTML document,
        that significantly increases the cost to user agents (and users) of
        checking for updates to the metadata of a site. Since the HTML file is
        likely to change often, it means that a user agent will often have to
        download the whole HTML file in order to check if any of the relevant
        meta tags have changed. If this resource contains inlined resources
        like JavaScript, images, or stylesheets, this could be a non-trivial
        download.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although it would be unrealistic to think that this specification won't
        bring its own set of problems, externalizing this data in the form of a
        manifest solves the problems described above. These problems are solved
        by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Making the manifest externally linkable: External manifest files
        can be cached as external resources, saving both bytes and redundancy
        in the markup.
        </li>
        <li>Flexible value types: unlike HTML attributes, members of the
        manifest can represent data using complex types, such as objects and
        arrays, rather than just strings. This solves the problem of the
        awkward and highly inconsistent formats the values of proprietary
        <code>meta</code> tags are currently using, especially when a tag's
        value contains several sub-values.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, standardizing the functionality currently provided by the
        various <code>meta</code> tag-based solutions within the manifest
        solves the problem of having to declare large number of proprietary and
        standard [[HTML]] tags that all achieve the same thing. Of course, this
        hinges on the standard actually getting implemented by browsers and
        those browsers getting widely deployed to users: if this happens, the
        Web community might be able to retire many of the proprietary
        <code>meta</code> tags plaguing the Web at the time of writing. More
        information about the proprietary tags can be found in the
        <cite><a href="https://w3c-webmob.github.io/installable-webapps/">Use
        Cases and Requirements for Installable Web Apps</a></cite> .
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, this specification does not make the standardized solutions
        found in [[HTML]] redundant. When members like the <code>name</code> or
        <code>icons</code> is missing from the manifest, user agents can search
        in a manifest's owner [[HTML]] document for things like icons and the
        application name (or a user agent might even fallback to proprietary
        tags/metadata, if they are present in a document).

        Internationalization
      </h2>
      <p>
        It is expected that authors will localize the content of a manifest by
        using one of the following options:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          Dynamically setting the language:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This can include, for instance, asking the end-user what their
          preferred language is and dynamically adding or replacing the
          manifest link relationship to the document based on that language
          preference (e.g., using a URL like "manifest.php?lang=fr").
        </dd>
        <dt>
          Using content-negotiation, or geotargeting, etc. on the server:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The server that hosts the web application could attempt to
          predetermine the end-user's language by using <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotargeting">geotargeting</a> or by
          using content negotiation (e.g., using [[RFC7540]]'s
          "<code>Accept-Language</code>" header, or even a custom HTTP header).
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Given the options above, developers need to be mindful of the
        end-user's privacy with respect to their preferred language: When the
        end-user has explicitly indicated their language preference to a web
        application (i.e., when not just using the user-agent default language
        settings), sending the end-user's preferred language in the clear over
        the wire is generally not OK. Doing so would reveal personal
        information about an end-user. As such, developers are encouraged to
        use [[TLS]] to reduce the chances of pervasive monitoring of their Web
        applications [[RFC7258]].
