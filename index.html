        This specification defines a JSON-based manifest that provides
        developers with a centralized place to put metadata associated with a
        web application. This includes, but is not limited to, the web
        application's name, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL to
        open when a user launches the web application. The manifest also allows
        developers to declare a default orientation for their web application,
        as well as providing the ability to set the display mode for the
        application (e.g., in fullscreen). Additionally, the manifest allows a
        developer to "scope" a web application to a URL. This restricts the
        URLs to which the application can be navigated and provides a means to
        "deep link" into a web application from other applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this metadata, user agents can provide developers with means to
        create user experiences that are more comparable to that of a native
        application.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, this specification defines the <code>manifest</code> link
        type, which provides a declarative means for a document to be
        associated with a manifest.

        The contributors to this specification believe that the specification
        is ready for implementation. Aspects of this specification are shipping
        in at least two browser (see links to implementation status at the top
        of this document). <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
        discussions will find the specification changing out from under them in
        incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this
        specification phase should <a href=

      <h2>
        Installable web applications
      </h2>
      <p>
        This document attempts to address the <cite><a href=
        "http://w3c-webmob.github.io/installable-webapps/">Use Cases and
        Requirements for Installable Web Apps</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A web application is <dfn>installed</dfn> if the user agent has
        provided the end-user with a means of instantiating a new <a>top-level
        browsing context</a> that has the manifest's members applied to it.
        That is, the manifest's members, or their defaults, are in effect on
        the <a>top-level browsing context</a> (see <a>application context</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of <a title="installed">installing</a> would be a user agent
        that allows the end-user to add a shortcut to a web application on
        their device's homescreen (using the name and one of the icons found in
        the manifest). Then, when the end-user launches a web application
        through this explicit means, the manifest is applied to the browsing
        context prior to the <a>start URL</a> being loaded. This gives the user
        agent time to apply the relevant values of the manifest, possibly
        changing the display mode and screen orientation of the web
        application. Alternatively, an application context can be launched
        through a <a>deep link</a> (a URL that is within scope of the installed
        web application); in which case, the manifest is applied and the deep
        link is loaded within the context of web application.

          Installability signals
        </h3>
        <p>
          By design, this specification does not provide developers with an
          explicit API to "install" a web application. Instead, a manifest can
          serve as an <dfn>installability signal</dfn> (amongst other <a title=
          "installability signal">signals</a>) to a user agent that a web
          application can be <a>installed</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a title="installability signal">Installability signals</a> can
          include things like the ones in the following list (this list is not
          exhaustive and some items might not apply to all user agents). For
          instance, the web application:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>contains a manifest with at least a <code>name</code> member and
          a suitable icon.
          </li>
          <li>is served over a secure network connection.
          </li>
          <li>has a sensible content security policy.
          </li>
          <li>is able to responsibly adapt to display on a variety of screen
          sizes, catering for both mobile and desktop.
          </li>
          <li>is able to function without a network connection.
          </li>
          <li>is repeatedly used by the end-user over some extended period of
          time.
          </li>
          <li>has been explicitly marked by the user as one that they value and
          trust (e.g., by bookmarking or "staring" it).
          </li>
          <li>And so on...
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          How a user agent makes use of these <a title=
          "installability signal">installability signals</a> to determine if a
          web application is installable is left to implementers.

      <h2>
        Navigation scope
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>navigation scope</dfn> is a [[!URL]] that represents the set of
        URLs to which an <a>application context</a> can be navigated while the
        manifest is <a>applied</a>. To determine if a URL is within the
        <a>navigation scope</a>, the user agent MUST run the <a>within
        scope</a> algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        A string <var>targetURL</var> is said the be <dfn>within scope</dfn> of
        navigation scope <var>scopeURL</var> if the following algorithm returns
        <code>true</code>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>If <var>scopeURL</var> is <code>undefined</code> (i.e., it is
        <a>unbounded</a> because of an error or it was not declared in the
        manifest), return <code>true</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Let <var>target</var> be a new URL using <var>targetURL</var> as
        input. If <var>target</var> is failure, return <code>false</code>.
        </li>
        <li>If <var>target</var> is <a>same origin</a> as <var>scope</var> and
        <var>target</var>'s <code>pathname</code> starts with
        <var>scope</var>'s <code>pathname</code>, return <code>true</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Otherwise, return <code>false</code>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="issue" title="🐒 Monkey patch">
        <p>
          Enforcing the navigation scope depends on [[!HTML]]'s navigate
          algorithm. As such, the following algorithm monkey patches [[!HTML]].
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=27653">Bug
          27653</a> has been filed to address this.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The user agent MUST navigate the application context as per [[!HTML]]'s
        navigate algorithm with exceptions enabled. If the URL being navigated
        to is not <a>within scope</a> of the navigation scope, then the user
        agent MUST behave as if the application context is not <a>allowed to
        navigate</a>: this provides the ability for the user agent to perform
        the navigation in a different browsing context - or in a different user
        agent entirely. If during the handle redirects step of HTML's <a title=
        "navigated">navigate algorithm</a>, if the redirect URL is not
        <a>within scope</a>, abort HTML's navigation algorithm with a
        <code>SecurityError</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A developer specifies the navigation scope via the
        <a><code>scope</code></a> member. In the case where the
        <a><code>scope</code></a> member is missing or in error, the navigation
        scope is treated as <dfn>unbounded</dfn> (represented as the value
        <code>undefined</code>). In such a case, the manifest is applied to all
        URLs the application context is <a>navigated</a> to (see related
        security considerations).
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Security considerations
        </h3>
        <p>
          When the navigation scope is <a>unbounded</a> and a <a>display
          mode</a> other than <code>browser</code> is being applied, it is
          RECOMMENDED that user agents signal to the end-user when security
          and/or privacy sensitive navigations occur. The manner of signaling
          is left up to implementers, but can include things like showing the
          URL of the application context, dropping out of fullscreen to the
          browser display mode. Examples of security and/or privacy sensitive
          navigations include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the application context being <a>navigated</a> from a secure
          connection to an insecure connection (or vice versa).
          </li>
          <li>the application context being <a>navigated</a> to a different
          origin.

        <p>
          A <dfn>deep link</dfn> is a URL that is <a>within scope</a> of an

        <div class="note">
          <p>
            The concept of a <a>deep link</a> is useful in that it allows
            hyperlinking from one installed application to another. This can be
            from a native application to an <a>installed</a> web application
            (and possibly vice versa!). Theoretically, this can provide
            seamless context switching between native and web applications
            through standard hyperlinks. And in the case where a particular web
            application is not <a>installed</a>, then the OS can just open the
            link in the user's preferred web browser.

      <h2>
        Display modes
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>display mode</dfn> represents how developers would like the user
        agent to present the web application to a user (e.g., in fullscreen).
        Display modes correspond to user interface (UI) metaphors and
        functionality in use on a given platform. The UI conventions of the
        display modes are purely advisory and implementers are free to
        interpret them how they best see fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a user agent applies a particular <a>display mode</a> to an
        <a>application context</a>, it becomes the <dfn>default display
        mode</dfn> for the <a>top-level browsing context</a> (i.e., it is used
        as the display mode when the window is <a>navigated</a>). The user
        agent MAY override the <a>default display mode</a> for security reasons
        (e.g., the <a>top-level browsing context</a> is <a>navigated</a> to
        another origin) and/or the user agent MAY provide the user with a means
        of switching to another <a>display mode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the <code>display</code> member is missing, or if there is no
        valid <code>display</code> member, the user agent uses the
        <code>browser</code> <a>display mode</a> as the <a>default display
        mode</a>. As such, the user agent is REQUIRED to support the
        <code>browser</code> <a>display mode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <a>display mode</a>, except <code>browser</code>, has a recursive
        <dfn>fallback display mode</dfn>, which is the <a>display mode</a> that
        the user agent can try to use if it doesn't support a particular
        <a>display mode</a>. If the user agent does support a fallback display
        mode, then it checks to see if it can use that display mode's fallback
        display mode. This creates a fallback chain, with the <a>default
        display mode</a> (<code>browser</code>) being the last item in the
        chain.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>
          For example, Awesome Browser only supports the
          <code>minimal-ui</code> and <code>browser</code> display modes, but a
          developer declares that she wants <code>fullscreen</code> in the
          manifest. In this case, the user agent will first check if it
          supports <code>fullscreen</code> (it doesn't), so it falls back to
          <code>standalone</code> (which it also doesn't support), and
          ultimately falls back to <code>minimal-ui</code>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The <dfn>display modes values</dfn> and their corresponding <a title=
        "fallback display mode">fallback display modes</a> are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <dfn id="dm-fullscreen">fullscreen</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Opens the web application without any user agent chrome and takes up
          the entirety of the available display area.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          The <a>fallback display mode</a> for <code>fullscreen</code> is
          <code>standalone</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn id="dm-standalone">standalone</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Opens the web application to look and feel like a standalone native
          application. This can include the application having a different
          window, its own icon in the application launcher, etc. In this mode,
          the user agent will exclude UI elements for controlling navigation,
          but can include other UI elements such as a status bar.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          The <a>fallback display mode</a> for <code>standalone</code> is
          <code>minimal-ui</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn id="dm-minimal-ui">minimal-ui</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          This mode is similar to <a>fullscreen</a>, but provides the end-user
          with some means to access a minimal set of UI elements for
          controlling navigation (i.e., back, forward, reload, and perhaps some
          way of viewing the document's address). A user agent can include
          other platform specific UI elements, such as "share" and "print"
          buttons or whatever is customary on the platform and user agent.
        </dd>
        <dd>
          The <a>fallback display mode</a> for <code>minimal-ui</code> is
          <code>browser</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn id="dm-browser">browser</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Opens the web application using the platform-specific convention for
          opening hyperlinks in the user agent (e.g., in a browser tab or a new
          window).
        </dd>
        <dd>
          The <code>browser</code> <a>display mode</a> doesn't have a
          <a>fallback display mode</a> (conforming user agents are required to
          support the <code>browser</code> <a>display mode</a>).
        </dd>
      </dl>

          anything has changed, the user agent MAY update the metadata
          corresponding to the web application (e.g., by replacing the name,
          icons, <a>navigation scope</a>, or whatever other data has been
          changed).
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, even if the manifest has not been modified, the user

        <p>
          If the user agent honors the value of the <code>orientation</code>

          <a>default orientation</a> for the life of the web application
          (unless overridden by some other means at runtime). This means that

        Icon object and its members
      </h2>
      <p>
        Each <dfn>icon object</dfn> represents an icon for a web application,
        suitable to use in various contexts (e.g., an application menu). As
        icons are usually images, this specification provides developers with a
        means of specifying the dimensions, optimal pixel density, and media
        type of an icon. A user agent can use these values to select an icon
        that is best suited to display on the end-user's device or most closely
        matches the end-user's preferences.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>
          In the following example, the developer has made the following
          choices about the icons of the web application:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The developer has included two icons at the same size, but in
          different formats. One is explicitly marked as WebP through the
          <code>type</code> member. If the user agent doesn't support WebP, it
          falls back to the second icon of the same size (and density). The
          media type of this icon can then be either determined via a HTTP
          header, or can be sniffed by the user agent once the first few bytes
          of the icon are received.
          </li>
          <li>The developer wants to use an SVG icon for devices with at least
          2dppx as the display density and only when the available dimensions
          are at least 72px. She has found that the SVG file looks too blurry
          at small sizes, even on high-density screens. To deal with this
          problem, she's included an SVG icon that is only used when the
          dimensions are at least 72px and the pixel density is at least 2dppx.
          Otherwise, the user agent uses the ICO file (hd_hi.ico), which
          includes a gamut of icons individually tailored for small display
          sizes.

          The <dfn title="icon-type">type</dfn> member of an icon is a hint as
          to the media type of the icon. The purpose of this member is to allow
          a user agent to ignore icons of media types it does not support.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no default MIME type for icon objects. However, for the
          purposes of <a>determining the type of the resource</a>, user agents
          must expect the resource to be an image.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>steps for processing the <code>type</code> member of an
          icon</dfn> are given by the following algorithm. The algorithm takes
          an <var>icon</var> object as an argument, and returns either a string
          or <code>undefined</code>.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Let <var>value</var> be the result of calling the
          <a>[[\GetOwnProperty]]</a> internal method of <var>potential
          icon</var> passing "<code>type</code>" as the argument.
          </li>
          <li>Let <var>type</var> be <a>Type</a>(<var>value</var>).
          </li>
          <li>If <var>type</var> is not "string", then:
            <ol>
              <li>If <var>type</var> is not "<code>undefined</code>", issue a
              developer warning that the type is unsupported.
              </li>
              <li>Return <code>undefined</code>.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Trim(<var>value</var>) and set <var>value</var> to be resulting
          string.
          </li>
          <li>If <var>value</var> is not a <a>valid MIME type</a> or the value
          of <var>type</var> is not a supported media format, issue a developer
          warning and return <code>undefined</code>.

        As the manifest uses the JSON format, this specification relies on the
        types defined in [[!ECMA-404]] specification: namely <dfn title=
        "json-object">object</dfn>, <dfn title="json-array">array</dfn>,
        <dfn title="json-number">number</dfn>, <dfn title=

        <code>null</code>. Strict type checking is not enforced by this
        specification. Instead, each member's definition specifies the steps
        required to process a particular member and what to do when a type does
        not match what is expected.

          registration with IANA.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>media type for a manifest</dfn> is
          <code>application/manifest+json</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the protocol over which the manifest is transferred supports the
          [[!MIME-TYPES]] specification (e.g. HTTP), it is RECOMMENDED that the
          manifest be labeled with the <a>media type for a manifest</a>.

          <dd>
            <p>
              As the manifest format is JSON and will commonly be encoded using
              [[!UNICODE]], the security considerations described in
              [[!ECMA-404]] and [[!UNICODE-SECURITY]] apply. In addition,
              because there is no way to prevent developers from including
              custom/unrestrained data in a <a>manifest</a>, implementors need
              to impose their own implementation-specific limits on the values
              of otherwise unconstrained member types, e.g. to prevent denial
              of service attacks, to guard against running out of memory, or to
              work around platform-specific limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web applications will generally contain ECMAScript, HTML, CSS
              files, and other media, which are executed in a sand-boxed
              environment. As such, implementors need to be aware of the
              security implications for the types they support. Specifically,
              implementors need to consider the security implications outlined
              in at least the following specifications: [[!CSS-MIME]],
              [[!ECMAScript-MIME]], [[!HTML]].
            </p>
            <p>
              As web applications can contain content that is able to
              simultaneously interact with the local device and a remote host,
              implementors need to consider the privacy implications resulting
              from exposing private information to a remote host. Mitigation
              and in-depth defensive measures are an implementation
              responsibility and not prescribed by this specification. However,
              in designing these measures, implementors are advised to enable
              user awareness of information sharing, and to provide easy access
              to interfaces that enable revocation of permissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              As this specification allows for the declaration of URLs within
              certain members of a manifest, implementors need to consider the
              security considerations discussed in the [[!WHATWG-URL]]
              specification. Implementations intending to display <abbr title=
              "Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRIs</abbr> and
              <abbr title="Internationalized domain name">IDNA</abbr> addresses
              found in the manifest are strongly encouraged to follow the
              security advice given in [[!UNICODE-SECURITY]].
            </p>
            <p>
              Developers need to be aware of the security considerations
              discussed throughout the [[!CSP2]] specification, particularly in
              relation to making <code>data:</code> a valid source for the
              purpose of <q>inlining</q> a manifest. Doing so can enable XSS
              attacks by allowing a manifest to be included directly in the
              document itself; this is best avoided completely.

          This specification is designed to be extensible. Other specifications
          are encouraged to define new members for the manifest. However, in
          doing so, please follow the conventions used in this specification.
          In particular, use the <a>extension point</a> to hook into the
          <a>steps for processing a manifest</a>. Also, be sure to specify the
          steps for processing your particular member in the manner set forth
          in this specification. This will help keep this part of the platform
          consistent.
        </p>
        <p>
          When specifying a new member, don't override or <a href=
          "http://annevankesteren.nl/2014/02/monkey-patch">monkey patch</a>
          anything defined in this specification. Also, don't assume your
          member will be processed before or after any other member. Keep your
          new member, and its processing, atomic and self contained. Note also
          that implementations are free to ignore any member they do not
          recognize or support.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are writing a specification and temporarily want to patch this
          specification to help implementations along, <a href=

          community is informed of what you are trying to do.

            Proprietary manifest members

          <p>
            Although proprietary extensions are undesirable, they can't
            realistically be avoided. As such, the RECOMMENDED way to add a new
            proprietary manifest member as an extension is to use a vendor
            prefix.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following is an example of two hypothetical vendor extensions.

        JSON-LD extensions to the manifest
      </h3>
      <p>
        The mechanisms defined by the [[JSON-LD]] specification can be used as
        an alternative mechanism for extending the manifest.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the following example, for instance, elements from both the Dublin
        Core Metadata Set [[DC-TERMS]], the Friend of a Friend [[FOAF]]
        vocabulary, and the <a href=
        "https://github.com/edumbill/doap/wiki">Description of a Project
        (DOAP)</a> vocabulary are used to provide additional information in the
        manifest:
      </p>
      <pre class="example hightlight json" title="JSON-LD extensions">
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/",
    "foaf": "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/",
    "dct": "http://purl.org/dc/terms/",
    "doap": "http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#"
  },
  "name": "Super Racer 2000",
  "dct:creator": "http://example.com",
  "dct:abstract": "A Super Racer Game!",
  "doap:maintainer": {
    "foaf:name": "Joe"
  },
  "icons": [{
    "src": "icon/lowres",
    "sizes": "64x64",
    "type": "image/webp"
  }, {
    "src": "icon/hd_small",
    "sizes": "64x64"
  }, {
    "src": "icon/hd_hi",
    "sizes": "128x128"
  }],
  "start_url": "/start.html",
  "display": "fullscreen",
  "orientation": "landscape"
}
</pre>
      <p>
        Non JSON-LD implementations can simply ignore the additional JSON-LD
        specific metadata such as <code>@context</code> and the extension
        properties <code>dct:creator</code>, <code>dct:abstract</code> and
        <code>doap:maintainer</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For implementations that do process the manifest as JSON-LD, the
        manifest's own property names are interpreted relative to the base URI
        "<code>http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/</code>".
      </p>
      <p>
        After processing the example above, a JSON-LD implementation would
        yield the following normalized output:

      <h2>
        Relationship to HTML's <code>link</code> and <code>meta</code> elements
      </h2>
      <p>
        An extensive discussion of why we chose to use JSON instead of HTML
        <code>meta</code>/<code>link</code> tags for this specification is
        available on <a href=
        "https://github.com/w3c/manifest/issues/97">GitHub</a> and on the
        <a href=
        "http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2014Jan/0139.html">www-tag</a>
        list. Below is a short summary of the key points raised in those
        discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The document format defined in this specification provides a unified
        means of encapsulating metadata about a Web application in a way that
        we hope will avoid existing pitfalls with both proprietary and
        [[!HTML]]'s <code>meta</code>/<code>link</code> tags. Those pitfalls
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developers have to duplicate the icons and application name in each
        page of a web site, leading to significant redundancy across pages.
        This is compounded if that information never gets used by the user
        agent (e.g., the user never bookmarks the web application).
        </li>
        <li>Spreading metadata across multiple documents can cause data to fall
        out of sync.
        </li>
        <li>If the metadata for a web application lives in a HTML document,
        that significantly increases the cost to user agents (and users) of
        checking for updates to the metadata of a site. Since the HTML file is
        likely to change often, it means that a user agent will often have to
        download the whole HTML file in order to check if any of the relevant
        meta tags have changed. If this resource contains inlined resources
        like JavaScript, images, or stylesheets, this could be a non-trivial
        download.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although it would be unrealistic to think that this specification won't
        bring its own set of problems, externalizing this data in the form of a
        manifest solves the problems described above. These problems are solved
        by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Making the manifest externally linkable: External manifest files
        can be cached as external resources, saving both bytes and redundancy
        in the markup.
        </li>
        <li>Flexible value types: unlike HTML attributes, members of the
        manifest can represent data using complex types, such as objects and
        arrays, rather than just strings. This solves the problem of the
        awkward and highly inconsistent formats the values of proprietary
        <code>meta</code> tags are currently using, especially when a tag's
        value contains several sub-values.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, standardizing the functionality currently provided by the
        various <code>meta</code> tag-based solutions within the manifest
        solves the problem of having to declare large number of proprietary and
        standard [[!HTML]] tags that all achieve the same thing. Of course,
        this hinges on the standard actually getting implemented by browsers
        and those browsers getting widely deployed to users: if this happens,
        the Web community might be able to retire many of the proprietary
        <code>meta</code> tags plaguing the Web at the time of writing. More
        information about the proprietary tags can be found in the
        <cite><a href="http://w3c-webmob.github.io/installable-webapps/">Use
        Cases and Requirements for Installable Web Apps</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, this specification does not make the standardized solutions
        found in [[!HTML]] redundant. When members like the <code>name</code>
        or <code>icons</code> is missing from the manifest, user agents can
        search in a manifest's owner [[!HTML]] document for things like icons
        and the application name (or a user agent might even fallback to
        proprietary tags/metadata, if they are present in a document).
