      <p>
        This specification defines a JSON-based <em>manifest</em>, which
        provides developers with a centralized place to put metadata about a
        web application. This includes, but is not limited to, the name of the
        web application, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL at which
        the web application should open when it is launched by the user. The
        manifest also allows developers to declare a default orientation for
        their web application, as well as how the application is to be
        displayed when launched (e.g., in fullscreen).
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this data, user agents can provide developers with a means to
        create user experiences that are more comparable to that of a native
        application.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification also defines an API to inform the user agent that
        the user wishes to bookmark the web application. It also provides a
        means for scripts to check if the web application was launched from a
        bookmark.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, this specification defines the <code>manifest</code> link
        type, which provides a declarative means for a document to be
        associated with a manifest.

        Implementors need to be aware that this specification is extremely
        unstable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
        discussions will find the specification changing out from under them in
        incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this
        specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation
        phase should join the aforementioned mailing lists, or <a href=

          The following example shows how a developer can ask a user to

          <code><span class=

          works through explicit user action; calling it without any user

        <dfn>Type</dfn>(<var>x</var>)</a> notation are defined in
        [[!ECMASCRIPT]]. Processing also relies on various algorithms defined

      </p>
      <p>
        When instructed to <dfn>Trim</dfn>(<var>x</var>), a user agent MUST

        As the manifest uses the JSON format, this specification relies on the
        types defined in [[!ECMA-404]] specification: namely <dfn title=
        "json-object">object</dfn>, <dfn title="json-array">array</dfn>,
        <dfn title="json-number">number</dfn>, <dfn title=
        "json-string">string</dfn>, <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and
        <code>null</code>. Strict type checking is not enforced by this
        specification. Instead, each member's definition specifies the steps
        required to process a particular member and what to do when a type does
        not match what is expected.

      <h2>
        Display modes
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>display mode</dfn> is the manner in which a developer would like
        the Web application to be shown to a user when it is launched from a
        bookmark (e.g., in <code><a href=
        "#idl-def-DisplayMode.fullscreen">fullscreen</a></code>). Display modes
        are intended to correspond to the user interface metaphors and
        functionality in use on a given platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a user agent applies a particular <a>display mode</a> to a web
        application, it becomes the <dfn>default display mode</dfn> for the
        top-level document of the browsing context (i.e., it is used as the
        display mode for all top-level documents to which the window is
        navigated). Other specifications, as well as the end user, MAY override
        the <a>default display mode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>display modes values</dfn> are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          "<code id="dm-browser">browser</code>"
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Opens the web application using the platform-specific convention for
          opening hyperlinks in the user agent (e.g., in a browser tab or a new
          window). The <code>browser</code> display mode is the <dfn>fallback
          display mode</dfn> to be used as the default if there is no valid
          <code>display</code> member in the manifest, or none of the preferred
          <a title="display mode">display modes</a> are supported by the user
          agent.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          "<code id="dm-standalone">standalone</code>"
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Opens the web application without UI elements for controlling
          navigation, but can include other UI elements such as a status bar.
          On desktop platforms, for example, this would open the bookmark in a
          standalone window outside the browser.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          "<code id="dm-fullscreen">fullscreen</code>"
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Opens the web application without any user agent&nbsp;chrome and
          takes up the entirety of the available display area.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          "<code id="dm-minimal-ui">minimal-ui</code>"
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Same as <a href="#dm-standalone">standalone</a>, but provides the
          end-user with some means to access a minimal set of UI elements for
          controlling navigation (i.e., back, forward, reload, and perhaps some
          way of viewing the document's address). A user agent MAY include
          other platform specific UI elements, such as "share" and "print"
          buttons or whatever is customary on the platform and/or user agent.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          "<code id="dm-unknown">unknown</code>"
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The display mode is unknown to the user agent, or the user agent does
          not provide the information, e.g. for privacy reasons.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>
        Manifest
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>manifest</dfn> is a JSON document that contains startup
        parameters and application defaults for when a web application is
        launched from a bookmark. A manifest consists of a top-level <a href=
        "#json-object">object</a> that contains zero or more members. Each of
        the members are defined below, as well as how their values are
        processed.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Obtaining a manifest
        </h3>
        <p>
          A user agent can obtain a manifest either from a top-level document
          or by fetching it directly from some URL (independently of a
          top-level document).
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent is said to have <dfn>obtained a manifest from a
          top-level document</dfn> when a user navigates to a web application
          and she or he explicitly makes a request to bookmark the top-level
          document. For example, the user uses the browser's user interface to
          either bookmark or add the web app to the home screen. The manifest
          is associated with a document through either the
          <code>manifest</code> link relationship or through the <a>well-known
          manifest</a> - this includes via successful requests to bookmark a
          web application through the <code>requestBookmark()</code> method.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, a user agent is said to have <dfn>obtained a manifest
          directly</dfn> when the user agent fetches the manifest independently
          of any top-level document. For example, a user agent fetches a
          manifest from a URL without first navigating to any
          <code>document</code> or the user agent makes use of the well-know
          manifest without first navigating to the web application.

        <h3>
          Fetching a manifest
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>steps for fetching a manifest</dfn> are given by the
          following algorithm. It takes a URL <var>url</var> as an argument.
          This algorithm will return either a response or an error.
        </p>

          <li>Let <var>response</var> be the result of <a href=

        <p>
          The <dfn>steps for processing a manifest</dfn> are given by the
          following algorithm. The algorithm takes a <var>text</var> string as
          an argument, which represents a <a>manifest</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When instructed to <dfn>issue a developer warning</dfn>, the user
          agent MAY report the conformance violation to the developer in a
          user-agent-specific manner (e.g., report the problem in an error
          console), or MAY ignore the error and do nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          When instructed to <dfn>ignore</dfn>, the user agent MUST act as if
          whatever member or value caused the condition was absent from the
          manifest document.

          Updating the manifest

        <p>
          A user agent MAY periodically check if the contents of a manifest has
          changed (e.g., by honoring HTTP cache directives associated with the
          manifest or by checking for updates after the web application has
          been launched). In the event the members of the manifest has been
          updated, as determined by running the <a>steps for processing a
          manifest</a> and seeing if anything has changed, the user agent MAY
          update the bookmark details corresponding to the web application
          (e.g., by updating the name, icons, or whatever other members have
          been changed). For security reasons, it is RECOMMENDED that users be
          made aware of any such updates using implementation or platform
          specific conventions.

          so forth. When the <a><code>default_orientation</code></a> member is
          missing, or all the declared items are unsupported, the user agent

          The "manifest.json" well-known URI
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>well-known manifest</dfn> is a manifest that a user agent
          fetches in the following manner. If a user agent attempts to obtain a
          manifest from a top-level document, but no <code><a href=
          "#rel-manifest">manifest</a></code> link relationship is declared,
          the user agent MUST attempt to <a href=
          "http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-fetch">fetch</a> a manifest
          from the <a href=
          "http://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-absolute-url">absolute URL</a>
          obtained by resolving the URL
          "<code>/.well-known/manifest.json</code>" against <a href=
          "http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-document's-address">
          the document's address</a>. The user agent can then use the resulting
          manifest as if the page had declared that <a>manifest</a> using the
          <code>manifest</code> keyword.
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification registers the "manifest.json" well-known URI in
          the <a href=
          "http://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xml">

          Media type registration
        </h3>
        <p>
          This section contains the required text for MIME media type
          registration with IANA.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>media type for a manifest</dfn> is
          <code>application/manifest+json</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the protocol over which the manifest is transferred supports the
          [[!MIME-TYPES]] specification (e.g. HTTP), it is RECOMMENDED that the
          manifest be labeled with the <a>media type for a manifest</a>.

            Optional parameters:

            Security considerations:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              As the manifest format is JSON and will commonly be encoded using
              [[!UNICODE]], the security considerations described in
              [[!ECMA-404]] and [[!UNICODE-SECURITY]] apply. In addition,
              implementors need to impose their own implementation-specific
              limits on the values of otherwise unconstrained member types,
              e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against
              running out of memory, or to work around platform-specific
              limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web applications will generally contain ECMAScript, HTML, CSS
              files, and other media, which are executed in a sand-boxed
              environment. As such, implementors need to be aware of the
              security implications for the types they support. Specifically,
              implementors need to consider the security implications outlined
              in at least the following specifications: [[!CSS-MIME]],
              [[!ECMAScript-MIME]], [[!HTML]].
            </p>
            <p>
              As web applications can contain content that is able to
              simultaneously interact with the local device and a remote host,
              implementors need to consider the privacy implications resulting
              from exposing private information to a remote host. Mitigation
              and in-depth defensive measures are an implementation
              responsibility and not prescribed by this specification. However,
              in designing these measures, implementors are advised to enable
              user awareness of information sharing, and to provide easy access
              to interfaces that enable revocation of permissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              As this specification allows for the declaration of URLs within
              certain members of a manifest, implementors need to consider the
              security considerations discussed in the [[!URL]] specification.
              Implementations intending to display <abbr title=
              "Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRIs</abbr> and
              <abbr title="Internationalized domain name">IDNA</abbr> addresses
              found in the manifest are strongly encouraged to follow the
              security advice given in [[!UNICODE-SECURITY]].
