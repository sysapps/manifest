      <p>
        This specification defines a JSON-based <em>manifest</em>, which
        provides developers with a centralized place to put metadata about a
        web application. This includes, but is not limited to, the name of the
        web application, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL at which
        the web application should open when it is launched by the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this metadata, user agents can provide, for example, enhanced
        bookmarking capabilities such as being able to add a web application or
        site to the homescreen of a device. The metadata allows developers to
        declare various icons, which a user agent can use to integrate the web
        application with an <abbr title="operating system">OS</abbr>'s task
        switcher and system preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specification also defines an API to enable bookmarking from within
        a document, as well as a way of checking if an application is running
        as "standalone" (conceptually outside of the browser).
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, this specification defines the <code>manifest</code> link
        type, which provides a declarative means for a web document to be
        associated with a manifest.

        Implementors should be aware that this specification is not stable.
        <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the discussions are
        likely to find the specification changing out from under them in
        incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this
        specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation
        phase should join the aforementioned mailing lists and take part in the
        discussions.

          The following example shows how a developer can ask a user to

          <code><span class=

          works through explicit user action; calling it without any user

          Using HTML <code>meta</code> elmements and a manifest together
        </h3>
        <p>
          During the <a>steps for processing a manifest</a>, how a user agent
          obtains a manifest determines how the metadata in a top-level
          document interacts with the metadata in the manifest (if at all). For
          example, when the user agent obtains a manifest from a top-level
          document, the metadata of the top-level document takes precedence
          over the metadata in the manifest. This means that, for instance,
          [[!HTML]]'s application-name will be used in favor of
          <code>name</code> member of the manifest.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, given the following manifest:
        </p>
        <pre class="example highlight json">
{"name": "My name is wha?"}
</pre>
        <p>
          And the HTML:
        </p>
        <pre>
<span class="example highlight html">&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;title&gt;I'm the real slim shady!&lt;/title&gt;</span>   
</pre>
        <p>
          The web application's name will be "<span class=
          "example highlight html">I'm the real slim shady</span>!".

        <dfn>Type</dfn>(<var>x</var>)</a> notation are defined in
        [[!ECMASCRIPT]]. Processing also relies on various algorithms defined

      </p>
      <p>
        When instructed to <dfn>Trim</dfn>(<var>x</var>), a user agent MUST
        behave as if [[!ECMASCRIPT]]'s <a href=
        "https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-string.prototype.trim">
        String.prototype.trim()</a> function had been called on the string
        <var>x</var>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the manifest is in the [[!JSON]] format, this specification relies
        on the types defined in [[!JSON]] specification: namely <dfn title=
        "json-object">object</dfn>, <dfn title="json-array">array</dfn>,
        <dfn title="json-number">number</dfn>, and <dfn title=
        "json-string">string</dfn>. Strict type checking is not enforced by
        this specification. Instead, each member's definition specifies the
        steps required to process a particular member and what to do when a
        type does not match what is expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        When an algorithm asks the user agent to <dfn>issue a developer
        warning</dfn>, the user agent MAY report the conformance violation to
        the developer in a user-agent-specific manner (e.g., show the problem
        in an error console), or MAY ignore the error and do nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        When instructed to <dfn>ignore</dfn> something while processing a
        member or value, the user agent MUST act as if whatever member or value
        caused the condition is absent in the manifest document.

      <h2>
        Manifest
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>manifest</dfn> is a [[!JSON]] document that contains metadata
        about a web application as well as presentational hints that a user
        agent can make use of when the web application is launched as
        standalone.
      </p>
      <p>
        A manifest typically consists of a top-level <a href=
        "#json-object">object</a> that contains zero or more members, some of
        which contain other objects. Each of the members are defined below, as
        well as how their values are processed.
      </p>

        <h3>
          Obtaining a manifest
        </h3>
        <p>
          A user agent can obtain a manifest either from a top-level document
          or by fetching it directly from some URL (independently of a
          top-level document).
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent is said to have <dfn>obtained a manifest from a
          top-level document</dfn> when a user navigates to a web application
          and she or he explicitly makes a request to bookmark the top-level
          document. For example, the user uses the browser's user interface to
          either bookmark or add the web app to the home screen. The manifest
          is associated with a document through either the
          <code>manifest</code> link relationship or through the
          <a><a>well-known manifest</a> - this includes via successful requests
          to bookmark a web application through the
          <code>requestBookmark()</code> method.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, a user agent is said to have <dfn>obtained a manifest
          directly</dfn> when the user agent fetches the manifest independently
          of any top-level document. For example, a user agent fetches a
          manifest from a URL without first navigating to any
          <code>document</code> or the user agent makes use of the well-know
          manifest without first navigating to the web application.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is OPTIONAL for a user agent to support the ability to <a>obtain a
          manifests directly</a>.

          Fetching a manifest
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>steps for fetching a manifest</dfn> are given by the
          following algorithm. It takes a URL <var>url</var> as an argument.
          This algorithm will return either a response or an error.

        </p>
        <p>
          Certain error conditions can result in a manifest being treated as an

          is deemed to be non-conforming in such a way that it would not be
          possible for the user agent to continue processing (e.g., it can't be
          parsed by the JSON parser because of syntax errors, it couldn't be
          fetched from the network). In such a case, it is RECOMMENDED that the
          user agent <a>issue a developer warning</a>. In either case, when a
          step results in an <a>invalid manifest</a> the user agent MUST abort
          whatever step or sub-step caused the condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          To obtain a manifest, a user agent MUST:

          <code>orientations</code> member
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>orientations</dfn> member is an array of strings that serve
          as hints for the user agent as to the preferred screen orientations
          in which to display the web application when it is launched as
          standalone. The possible values are any of the <a href=
          "https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/screen-orientation/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#allowed-orientations">
          allowed orientations</a> as defined in [[!screen-orientation]]. Order
          within the array is significant, with the first item being the most
          preferred by the developer, followed by the next most preferred and
          so forth. When the <a>orientations</a> member is missing or the value
          is <span data-dobid="hdw">erroneous</span>, the user agent provides a
          user agent specific default orientation for the web application.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the specification relies on the <a href=
          "https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/screen-orientation/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#allowed-orientations">
          allowed orientations</a> from the [[!screen-orientation]]
          specification, it is OPTIONAL for a user agent to implement the
          [[!screen-orientation]] API. Supporting the [[!screen-orientation]]
          is, of course, RECOMMENDED.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the user agent chooses to use one of the <a href=
          "https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/screen-orientation/raw-file/tip/Overview.html#allowed-orientations">
          allowed orientations</a> in the <code>orientations</code> member,
          then that becomes the default orientation for the web application for
          as long as the application is running (unless overridden by some
          other means at runtime). This means that the user agent MUST return
          the orientation to the default orientation any time the orientation
          is unlocked [[!screen-orientation]].
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: the <code>orientations</code> member's items are expected to
          only apply when the web application is launched. Once the web
          application is running, it is expected that other means can could be
          used to change the orientation of the application (such as via
          [[!screen-orientation]]).
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>steps for processing the <code>orientations</code> member of
          the app object</dfn> are given by the following algorithm. The
          algorithm takes an <a>app object</a> (<var>app</var>) as an argument,

          The <dfn>well-known manifest</dfn> is a manifest that a user agent
          fetches in the following manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a user agent attempts to <a>obtain a manifest from a top-level
          document</a>, but no manifest link relationship is declared, the user
          agent MUST attempt to <a href=
          "http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-fetch">fetch</a> a manifest
          from the <a href=
          "http://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-absolute-url">absolute URL</a>
          obtained by resolving the URL
          "<code>/.well-known/manifest.json</code>" against <a href=
          "http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-document's-address">
          the document's address</a>. The user agent can then use the resulting
          manifest as if the page had declared that <a>manifest</a> using the
          <code>manifest</code> keyword.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case where the user agent obtains the manifest directly, the
          user agent MAY attempt to <a href=
          "http://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-fetch">fetch</a> a manifest
          with the <a href=
          "http://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-absolute-url">absolute URL</a>
          obtained by resolving the URL
          "<code>/.well-known/manifest.json</code>" against an applicaiton
          specific base URL (e.g., the URL
          "<code>app://abc123/.well-known/manifest.json</code>").
        </p>
        <p>
          This specification registers the "manifest.json" well-known URI in
          the <a href=

          Media type registration
        </h3>
        <p>
          This section contains the required text for MIME media type
          registration with IANA.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>media type for a manifest</dfn> is
          <code>application/manifest+json</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the protocol over which the manifest is transferred supports the
          [[!MIME-TYPES]] specification (e.g. HTTP), it is RECOMMENDED that the
          manifest be labeled with the <a>media type for a manifest</a>.

            Security considerations:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              As the manifest format is JSON and will commonly be encoded using
              [[!UNICODE]], the security considerations described in [[!JSON]]
              and [[!UNICODE-SECURITY]] apply. In addition, implementors need
              to impose their own implementation-specific limits on the values
              of otherwise unconstrained member types, e.g. to prevent denial
              of service attacks, to guard against running out of memory, or to
              work around platform-specific limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web applications will generally contain ECMAScript, HTML, CSS
              files, and other media, which are executed in a sand-boxed
              environment. As such, implementors need to be aware of the
              security implications for the types they support. Specifically,
              implementors need to consider the security implications outlined
              in the [[!CSS-MIME]] specification, the [[!ECMAScript-MIME]]
              specification, and the [[!HTML]] specification.
            </p>
            <p>
              As web applications can contain content that is able to
              simultaneously interact with the local device and a remote host,
              implementors need to consider the privacy implications resulting
              from exposing private information to a remote host. Mitigation
              and in-depth defensive measures are an implementation
              responsibility and not prescribed by this specification. However,
              in designing these measures, implementors are advised to enable
              user awareness of information sharing, and to provide easy access
              to interfaces that enable revocation of permissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              As this specification allows for the declaration of URLs within
              certain members of a manifest, implementors need to consider the
              security considerations discussed in the [[!URL]] specification.
              Implementations intending to display <abbr title=
              "Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRIs</abbr> and
              <abbr title="Internationalized domain name">IDNA</abbr> addresses
              found in the manifest are strongly encouraged to follow the
              security advice given in [[!UNICODE-SECURITY]].
