      <p>
        This specification defines a JSON-based manifest that provides
        developers with a centralized place to put metadata associated with a
        web application. This includes, but is not limited to, the web
        application's name, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL to
        open when a user launches the web application. The manifest also allows
        developers to declare a default orientation for their web application,
        as well as providing the ability to set the display mode for the
        application (e.g., in fullscreen). Additionally, the manifest allows a
        developer to "scope" a web application to a URL. This restricts the
        URLs to which the manifest is applied and provides a means to "deep
        link" into a web application from other applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this metadata, user agents can provide developers with means to
        create user experiences that are more comparable to that of a native
        application.
      </p>
      <p>
        To associate documents of a web application with a manifest, this
        specification defines the <code>manifest</code> link type as a
        declarative means for a document to be associated with a manifest
        (either directly in a HTML document or over the wire using
        [[RFC5988]]).

      <h2>
        Installable web applications
      </h2>
      <p>
        This document attempts to address the <cite><a href=
        "https://w3c-webmob.github.io/installable-webapps/">Use Cases and
        Requirements for Installable Web Apps</a></cite> .
      </p>
      <p>
        A web application is <dfn>installed</dfn> if the user agent has
        provided the end-user with a means of instantiating a new <a>top-level
        browsing context</a> that has the manifest's members applied to it.
        That is, the manifest's members, or their defaults, are in effect on
        the <a>top-level browsing context</a> (see <a>application context</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of <a title="installed">installing</a> would be a user agent
        that allows the end-user to add a shortcut to a web application on
        their device's homescreen (using the name and one of the icons found in
        the manifest). Then, when the end-user launches a web application
        through this explicit means, the manifest is applied to the browsing
        context prior to the <a>start URL</a> being loaded. This gives the user
        agent time to apply the relevant values of the manifest, possibly
        changing the display mode and screen orientation of the web
        application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, an application context can be launched through a <a>deep
        link</a> (a URL that is within scope of the installed web application);
        in which case, the manifest is applied and the deep link is loaded
        within the context of web application.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Identity
        </h3>
        <p>
          This specification assumes that when a web application is
          <a>installed</a>, it is given an <dfn>identity</dfn>: that is, the
          web application gets some kind of unique identifier assigned to it by
          either the user agent or the underlying OS. The identity serves to
          uniquely identify the installed web application amongst other native
          and <a>installed</a> web applications. The identity also facilitates
          the life cycle management of the web application, including updates
          and uninstallation, and possibly management of API permissions, local
          storage, and cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is RECOMMENDED that a user agent <a title="identity">identify</a>
          an installed web application via the manifest's URL.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Authors need to take care to avoid assigning the same manifest URL to
          multiple web applications on a single domain. Failure to do so can
          result in the web application not being installed. Please also note
          that manifest's URL has to be <a>same origin</a>, so you can't use
          them directly with a <abbr title=
          "content distribution network">CDN</abbr>.

        <h3>
          Installability signals
        </h3>
        <p>
          By design, this specification does not provide developers with an
          explicit API to "install" a web application. Instead, a manifest can
          serve as an <dfn>installability signal</dfn> (amongst other <a title=
          "installability signal">signals</a>) to a user agent that a web
          application can be <a>installed</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a title="installability signal">Installability signals</a> can
          include things like the ones in the following list (this list is not
          exhaustive and some items might not apply to all user agents). For
          instance, the web application:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>contains a manifest with at least a <code>name</code> member and
          a suitable icon.
          </li>
          <li>is served over a secure network connection.
          </li>
          <li>has a sensible content security policy.
          </li>
          <li>is able to responsibly adapt to display on a variety of screen
          sizes, catering for both mobile and desktop.
          </li>
          <li>is able to function without a network connection.
          </li>
          <li>is repeatedly used by the end-user over some extended period of
          time.
          </li>
          <li>has been explicitly marked by the user as one that they value and
          trust (e.g., by bookmarking or "starring" it).
          </li>
          <li>And so on...
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          How a user agent makes use of these <a title=
          "installability signal">installability signals</a> to determine if a
          web application is installable is left to implementers.

      <h2>
        Navigation scope
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>navigation scope</dfn> is a [[!URL]] that represents the set of
        URLs to which an <a>application context</a> can be navigated while the
        manifest is <a>applied</a>. To determine if a URL is within the
        <a>navigation scope</a>, the user agent MUST run the <a>within
        scope</a> algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        A string <var>targetURL</var> is said the be <dfn>within scope</dfn> of
        navigation scope <var>scopeURL</var> if the following algorithm returns
        <code>true</code>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>If <var>scopeURL</var> is <code>undefined</code> (i.e., it is
        <a>unbounded</a> because of an error or it was not declared in the
        manifest), return <code>true</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Let <var>target</var> be a new URL using <var>targetURL</var> as
        input. If <var>target</var> is failure, return <code>false</code>.
        </li>
        <li>If <var>target</var> is <a>same origin</a> as <var>scope</var> and
        <var>target</var>'s <code>pathname</code> starts with
        <var>scope</var>'s <code>pathname</code>, return <code>true</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Otherwise, return <code>false</code>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <div class="issue" title="🐒 Monkey patch">
        <p>
          Enforcing the navigation scope depends on [[!HTML]]'s navigate
          algorithm. As such, the following algorithm monkey patches [[!HTML]].
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=27653">Bug
          27653</a> has been filed to address this.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        The user agent MUST navigate the application context as per [[!HTML]]'s
        navigate algorithm with exceptions enabled. If the URL being navigated
        to is not <a>within scope</a> of the navigation scope, then the user
        agent MUST behave as if the application context is not <a>allowed to
        navigate</a>: this provides the ability for the user agent to perform
        the navigation in a different browsing context - or in a different user
        agent entirely. If during the handle redirects step of HTML's <a title=
        "navigated">navigate algorithm</a>, if the redirect URL is not
        <a>within scope</a>, abort HTML's navigation algorithm with a
        <code>SecurityError</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A developer specifies the navigation scope via the
        <a><code>scope</code></a> member. In the case where the
        <a><code>scope</code></a> member is missing or in error, the navigation
        scope is treated as <dfn>unbounded</dfn> (represented as the value
        <code>undefined</code>). In such a case, the manifest is applied to all
        URLs the application context is <a>navigated</a> to (see related
        security considerations).
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Security considerations
        </h3>
        <p>
          When the navigation scope is <a>unbounded</a> and a <a>display
          mode</a> other than <code>browser</code> is being applied, it is
          RECOMMENDED that user agents signal to the end-user when security
          and/or privacy sensitive navigations occur. The manner of signaling
          is left up to implementers, but can include things like showing the
          URL of the application context, dropping out of fullscreen to the
          browser display mode. Examples of security and/or privacy sensitive
          navigations include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the application context being <a>navigated</a> from a secure
          connection to an insecure connection (or vice versa).
          </li>
          <li>the application context being <a>navigated</a> to a different
          origin.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This specification distinguishes between behavior in first-party and
          third-party contexts. In particular, if a <code>scope</code> member
          is declared in the manifest, it is not possible to navigate the
          top-level browsing context to somewhere outside the scope while the
          manifest is being applied. That's not to say that the web application
          cannot be navigated: just that the set of URLs to which the manifest
          applies is restricted by the <a>navigation scope</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Deep links
        </h3>
        <p>
          A <dfn>deep link</dfn> is a URL that is <a>within scope</a> of an
          <a>installed</a> web application.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <p>
            The concept of a <a>deep link</a> is useful in that it allows
            hyperlinking from one installed application to another. This can be
            from a native application to an <a>installed</a> web application
            (and possibly vice versa!). Theoretically, this can provide
            seamless context switching between native and web applications
            through standard hyperlinks. And in the case where a particular web
            application is not <a>installed</a>, then the OS can just open the
            link in the user's preferred web browser.

      <h2>
        Display modes
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>display mode</dfn> represents how the web application is being
        presented within the context of an OS (e.g., in fullscreen, etc.).
        Display modes correspond to user interface (UI) metaphors and
        functionality in use on a given platform. The UI conventions of the
        display modes are purely advisory and implementers are free to
        interpret them how they best see fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a user agent applies a particular <a>display mode</a> to an
        <a>application context</a>, it becomes the <dfn>default display
        mode</dfn> for the <a>top-level browsing context</a> (i.e., it is used
        as the display mode when the window is <a>navigated</a>). The user
        agent MAY override the <a>default display mode</a> for security reasons
        (e.g., the <a>top-level browsing context</a> is <a>navigated</a> to
        another origin) and/or the user agent MAY provide the user with a means
        of switching to another <a>display mode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the <code>display</code> member is missing, or if there is no
        valid <code>display</code> member, the user agent uses the
        <code>browser</code> <a>display mode</a> as the <a>default display
        mode</a>. As such, the user agent is REQUIRED to support the
        <code>browser</code> <a>display mode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each <a>display mode</a>, except <code>browser</code>, has a recursive
        <dfn>fallback display mode</dfn>, which is the <a>display mode</a> that
        the user agent can try to use if it doesn't support a particular
        <a>display mode</a>. If the user agent does support a fallback display
        mode, then it checks to see if it can use that display mode's fallback
        display mode. This creates a fallback chain, with the <a>default
        display mode</a> (<code>browser</code>) being the last item in the
        chain.

          manifest. In this case, the user agent will first check if it
          supports <code>fullscreen</code> (it doesn't), so it falls back to
          <code>standalone</code> (which it also doesn't support), and
          ultimately falls back to <code>minimal-ui</code>.

          Opens the web application to look and feel like a standalone native
          application. This can include the application having a different
          window, its own icon in the application launcher, etc. In this mode,
          the user agent will exclude UI elements for controlling navigation,

          The <code>'display-mode'</code> media feature
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <code><dfn>display-mode</dfn></code> media feature represents,
          via a CSS media query [[!MEDIAQ]], the <a>display mode</a> of the web
          application. This media feature applies to the top-level browsing
          context and any child browsing contexts. Child browsing contexts
          reflect the <a>display mode</a> of the <a>top-level browsing
          context</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent MUST expose the '<code>display-mode</code>' media
          feature irrespective of whether a manifest is being applied to a
          browsing context. For example, if the end-user puts the whole user
          agent into fullscreen, then the user agent would reflect this change
          to CSS and scripts via the '<code>display-mode</code>' media feature.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          <p>
            Please note that the <code>fullscreen</code> <a>display mode</a> is
            not directly related to the CSS <code>:fullscreen</code>
            pseudo-class specified in the [[WHATWG-FULLSCREEN]] API. The
            <code>:fullscreen</code> pseudo-class matches exclusively when a
            [[!HTML]] element is put into the fullscreen element stack.
            However, a side effect of calling the
            <code>requestFullscreen()</code> method on an element using the
            [[WHATWG-FULLSCREEN]] API is that the browser window can enter a
            fullscreen mode at the OS-level. In such a case, both
            <code>:fullscreen</code> and <code>(display-mode:
            fullscreen)</code> will match.
          </p>
          <p>
            On some platforms, it is possible for a user to put a browser
            window into fullscreen without the aid of the [[WHATWG-FULLSCREEN]]
            API. When this happens, the <code>:fullscreen</code> pseudo class
            will not match, but <code>(display-mode: fullscreen)</code> will
            match. This is exemplified in CSS code below.

            Security and privacy considerations
          </h3>
          <p>
            The <code>'display-mode'</code> media feature allows an origin
            access to aspects of a user’s local computing environment and,
            together with the <code>display</code> member, allows an origin
            some measure of control over a user agent’s native UI: Through a
            CSS media query, a script can know the display mode of a web
            application. An attacker could, in such a case, exploit the fact
            that an application is being displayed in fullscreen to mimic the
            user interface of another application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, by neglecting to define a scope member in the
            manifest, it's possible to put a web application into a <a>display
            mode</a> that persists cross-origin (for legacy reasons, this is
            the default behavior). In case where the navigation scope is
            unbounded, it is left to the user agent to either stop applying the
            manifest when a cross-origin navigation occurs or to show some sort
            of security warning to the user.

        <p>
          A <a>manifest</a> is <dfn>applied</dfn> to a <a>top-level browsing
          context</a>, meaning that the members of the <a>manifest</a> are
          affecting the presentation or behavior of a browsing context.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a>top-level browsing context</a> that has a manifest applied to it
          is referred to as an <dfn>application context</dfn>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an <a>application context</a> is created as a result of the user
          agent being asked to <a title="navigated">navigate</a> to a <a>deep
          link</a>, the user agent MUST immediately <a title=
          "navigated">navigate</a> to the <a>deep link</a> with <a>replacement
          enabled</a>. Otherwise, when the <a>application context</a> is

        </p>

          <p>
            Please note that the <a>start URL</a> is not necessarily the value
            of the start_url member: the user or user agent could have changed
            it when the application was added to home-screen or otherwise
            bookmarked.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The appropriate time to <a title="applied">apply</a> a manifest is

          Updating the manifest
        </h3>
        <p>
          By using the <a>manifest URL</a>, a user agent MAY periodically check
          if the contents of a manifest has been modified (e.g., by honoring
          HTTP cache directives associated with the manifest or by checking for
          updates after the web application has been launched). In the event
          that the members of the manifest have been updated, as determined by
          running the <a>steps for processing a manifest</a> and seeing if
          anything has changed, the user agent MAY update the metadata
          corresponding to the web application (e.g., by replacing the name,
          icons, <a>navigation scope</a>, or whatever other data has been
          changed).
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, even if the manifest has not been modified, the user
          agents MAY periodically check if resources referenced from a manifest
          (e.g., the icons) have been modified by honoring HTTP cache
          directives. If any resources have been modified, the user agent MAY
          replace any stale resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid one application masquerading as another, it is RECOMMENDED
          that users be made aware of any such updates using implementation or
          platform specific conventions.

        Manifest and its members
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>manifest</dfn> is a JSON document that contains startup
        parameters and application defaults for when a web application is
        launched. A manifest consists of a top-level <a title=
        "json-object">object</a> that contains zero or more members. Each of
        the members are defined below, as well as how their values are
        processed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every manifest has an associated <dfn>manifest URL</dfn>, which the
        [[!URL]] from which the <a>manifest</a> was fetched.

        <p>
          The <dfn id="member-lang"><code>lang</code></dfn> member is a
          <a>language tag</a> (string) that specifies the primary language for
          the values of the manifest's <code>name</code> and
          <code>short_name</code> members.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <dfn>language tag</dfn> is a string that matches the production of
          a <code>Language-Tag</code> defined in the [[!BCP47]] specifications

          Maintenance Agency for ISO 3166 country codes</a>). That is, a
          language range is composed of one or more <dfn>subtags</dfn> that are
          delimited by a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS ("-"). For example, the
          '<code>en-AU</code>' language range represents English as spoken in
          Australia, and '<code>fr-CA</code>' represents French as spoken in
          Canada. Language tags that meet the validity criteria of [[!RFC5646]]

        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn id="member-splash_screens"><code>splash_screens</code></dfn>
          member is an <a title="json-array">array</a> of <a title=
          "image object">image objects</a> that can serve as a loading screen
          for the web application. A splash screen indicates to the end user
          that a loading process is occurring (in effect, that the web
          application is being prepared by the user agent in the background).
          As the <code>splash_screens</code> member is an array of <a title=
          "image object">image objects</a>, developers can use unique image
          objects definitions to target minimum screen resolutions and pixel
          densities.
        </p>
        <p>
          This feature is primarily intended for user agents that take a
          perceptible amount of time to self-initialize (e.g., take longer than
          200ms to be able to render content) - as such, it is OPTIONAL for a
          user agent to display a splash screen while the web application is
          being loaded. On launching a web application, if displaying a splash
          screen, the user agent MUST <a>queue a post-load task</a> on the
          <code>Document</code> of the <a>start URL</a> to remove the
          splashscreen, or, alternatively can follow platform conventions for
          how long a splash screen is displayed (e.g., a minimum of 1 second).
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The <code>splashscreen</code> member is processed using the <a>steps
          for processing an array of images</a>.

          The <dfn id="member-icons"><code>icons</code></dfn> member is an
          <a title="json-array">array</a> of <a title="image object">image
          objects</a> that can serve as iconic representations of the web
          application in various contexts. For example, they can be used to
          represent the web application amongst a list of other applications,
          or to integrate the web application with an <abbr title=
          "operating system">OS</abbr>'s task switcher and/or system
          preferences.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          The <code>splashscreen</code> member is processed using the <a>steps

        </p>
        <p class="note">
          If no icons are listed in the manifest (or none of them are found to
          be suitable during processing), it is RECOMMENDED that the user agent
          fall back to using any icons found in the <code>Document</code> of
          the <a>top-level browsing context</a>. For example, an <a>icon link
          type</a> and/or a <code>favicon.ico</code> can serve as suitable
          fallbacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there are multiple equally appropriate icons in <var>icons</var>,
          a user agent MUST use the last one declared in order at the time that
          the user agent collected the list of <var>icons</var>. If the user
          agent tries to use an icon but that icon is determined, upon closer
          examination, to in fact be inappropriate (e.g. because its content
          type is unsupported), then the user agent MUST try the
          next-most-appropriate icon as determined by examining the <a title=
          "image object">image object's</a> members.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
          <p>
            In the following example, the developer has made the following
            choices about the icons associated with the web application:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The developer has included two icons at the same size, but in
            two different formats. One is explicitly marked as WebP through the
            <code>type</code> member. If the user agent doesn't support WebP,
            it falls back to the second icon of the same size (and density).
            The media type of this icon can then be either determined via a
            HTTP header, or can be sniffed by the user agent once the first few
            bytes of the icon are received.
            </li>
            <li>The developer wants to use an SVG icon for devices with at
            least 2dppx as the display density and only when the available
            dimensions are at least 72px. She has found that the SVG file looks
            too blurry at small sizes, even on high-density screens. To deal
            with this problem, she's included an SVG icon that is only used
            when the dimensions are at least 72px and the pixel density is at
            least 2dppx. Otherwise, the user agent uses the ICO file
            (hd_hi.ico), which includes a gamut of icons individually tailored
            for small display sizes.

        </p>
        <p>
          If the user agent honors the value of the <code>orientation</code>
          member as the <a>default orientation</a>, then that serves as the
          <a>default orientation</a> for the life of the web application
          (unless overridden by some other means at runtime). This means that
          the user agent MUST return the orientation to the <a>default

          agent to implement the [[!SCREEN-ORIENTATION]] API. Supporting the

          together is left to the discretion of implementers. For example, for
          some user agents, it might not make sense to change the <a>default
          orientation</a> of an application while in <code>browser</code>

            provide use cases for it. If you have any feedback, please comment

          The <dfn id="member-theme_color"><code>theme_color</code></dfn>
          member serves as the <dfn>default theme color</dfn> for an
          application context. What constitutes a <dfn>theme color</dfn> is
          defined in [[!META-THEME-COLOR]].
        </p>
        <p>
          If the user agent honors the value of the <code>theme_color</code>
          member as the <a>default theme color</a>, then that color serves as
          the <a>theme color</a> for all browsing contexts to which the
          manifest is <a>applied</a>. However, a document may override the
          <a>default theme color</a> through the inclusion of a [[!HTML]]
          <code>meta</code> element that conforms to [[!META-THEME-COLOR]]. A
          user agent MUST return the theme color to the <a>default theme
          color</a> when there are no <code>meta</code> elements that conform
          to [[!META-THEME-COLOR]] in a document, or the <a>top-level browsing

        <p class="note">
          For all intents and purposes, the <a><code>theme_color</code></a>

        Each <dfn>image object</dfn> represents an image that is used as part

        the semantics of the member that is using the object (e.g., an icon

        image object, this specification provides developers with a means of
        specifying the dimensions, optimal pixel density, and media type of an
        image (i.e., a "responsive image" solution [[respimg-usecases]]). A
        user agent can use these values to select an image that is best suited
        to display on the end-user's device or most closely matches the
        end-user's preferences.

          This section contains the required text for MIME media type

        <p>
          If the protocol over which the manifest is transferred supports the
          [[!MIME-TYPES]] specification (e.g. HTTP), it is RECOMMENDED that the
          manifest be labeled with the <a>media type for a manifest</a>.

          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              This specification does not directly deal with high-value data.
              However, <a>installed</a> web applications and their data could
              be seen as "high value" (particularly from a privacy
              perspective).
            </p>
            <p>
              As the manifest format is JSON and will commonly be encoded using
              [[!UNICODE]], the security considerations described in
              [[!ECMA-404]] and [[!UNICODE-SECURITY]] apply. In addition,
              because there is no way to prevent developers from including
              custom/unrestrained data in a <a>manifest</a>, implementors need
              to impose their own implementation-specific limits on the values
              of otherwise unconstrained member types, e.g. to prevent denial
              of service attacks, to guard against running out of memory, or to
              work around platform-specific limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web applications will generally contain ECMAScript, HTML, CSS
              files, and other media, which are executed in a sand-boxed
              environment. As such, implementors need to be aware of the
              security implications for the types they support. Specifically,
              implementors need to consider the security implications outlined
              in at least the following specifications: [[!CSS-MIME]],
              [[!ECMAScript-MIME]], [[!HTML]].
            </p>
            <p>
              As web applications can contain content that is able to
              simultaneously interact with the local device and a remote host,
              implementors need to consider the privacy implications resulting
              from exposing private information to a remote host. Mitigation
              and in-depth defensive measures are an implementation
              responsibility and not prescribed by this specification. However,
              in designing these measures, implementors are advised to enable
              user awareness of information sharing, and to provide easy access
              to interfaces that enable revocation of permissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              As this specification allows for the declaration of URLs within
              certain members of a manifest, implementors need to consider the
              security considerations discussed in the [[!WHATWG-URL]]
              specification. Implementations intending to display <abbr title=
              "Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRIs</abbr> and
              <abbr title="Internationalized domain name">IDNA</abbr> addresses
              found in the manifest are strongly encouraged to follow the
              security advice given in [[!UNICODE-SECURITY]].
            </p>
            <p>
              Developers need to be aware of the security considerations
              discussed throughout the [[!CSP3]] specification, particularly in
              relation to making <code>data:</code> a valid source for the
              purpose of <q>inlining</q> a manifest. Doing so can enable XSS
              attacks by allowing a manifest to be included directly in the
              document itself; this is best avoided completely.

        <p>
          This specification is designed to be extensible. Other specifications
          are encouraged to define new members for the manifest. However, in
          doing so, please follow the conventions used in this specification.
          In particular, use the <a>extension point</a> to hook into the
          <a>steps for processing a manifest</a>. Also, be sure to specify the
          steps for processing your particular member in the manner set forth
          in this specification. This will help keep this part of the platform
          consistent.
        </p>
        <p>
          When specifying a new member, don't override or <a href=
          "https://annevankesteren.nl/2014/02/monkey-patch">monkey patch</a>
          anything defined in this specification. Also, don't assume your
          member will be processed before or after any other member. Keep your
          new member, and its processing, atomic and self contained. Note also
          that implementations are free to ignore any member they do not
          recognize or support.

            realistically be avoided. As such, the RECOMMENDED way to add a new

        Relationship to HTML's <code>link</code> and <code>meta</code> elements
      </h2>
      <p>
        An extensive discussion of why we chose to use JSON instead of HTML
        <code>meta</code>/<code>link</code> tags for this specification is
        available on <a href=
        "https://github.com/w3c/manifest/issues/97">GitHub</a> and on the
        <a href=
        "https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-tag/2014Jan/0139.html">www-tag</a>
        list. Below is a short summary of the key points raised in those
        discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The document format defined in this specification provides a unified
        means of encapsulating metadata about a Web application in a way that
        we hope will avoid existing pitfalls with both proprietary and
        [[!HTML]]'s <code>meta</code>/<code>link</code> tags. Those pitfalls
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developers have to duplicate the icons and application name in each
        page of a web site, leading to significant redundancy across pages.
        This is compounded if that information never gets used by the user
        agent (e.g., the user never bookmarks the web application).
        </li>
        <li>Spreading metadata across multiple documents can cause data to fall
        out of sync.
        </li>
        <li>If the metadata for a web application lives in a HTML document,
        that significantly increases the cost to user agents (and users) of
        checking for updates to the metadata of a site. Since the HTML file is
        likely to change often, it means that a user agent will often have to
        download the whole HTML file in order to check if any of the relevant
        meta tags have changed. If this resource contains inlined resources
        like JavaScript, images, or stylesheets, this could be a non-trivial
        download.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although it would be unrealistic to think that this specification won't
        bring its own set of problems, externalizing this data in the form of a
        manifest solves the problems described above. These problems are solved
        by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Making the manifest externally linkable: External manifest files
        can be cached as external resources, saving both bytes and redundancy
        in the markup.
        </li>
        <li>Flexible value types: unlike HTML attributes, members of the
        manifest can represent data using complex types, such as objects and
        arrays, rather than just strings. This solves the problem of the
        awkward and highly inconsistent formats the values of proprietary
        <code>meta</code> tags are currently using, especially when a tag's
        value contains several sub-values.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, standardizing the functionality currently provided by the
        various <code>meta</code> tag-based solutions within the manifest
        solves the problem of having to declare large number of proprietary and
        standard [[!HTML]] tags that all achieve the same thing. Of course,
        this hinges on the standard actually getting implemented by browsers
        and those browsers getting widely deployed to users: if this happens,
        the Web community might be able to retire many of the proprietary
        <code>meta</code> tags plaguing the Web at the time of writing. More
        information about the proprietary tags can be found in the
        <cite><a href="https://w3c-webmob.github.io/installable-webapps/">Use
        Cases and Requirements for Installable Web Apps</a></cite> .
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, this specification does not make the standardized solutions
        found in [[!HTML]] redundant. When members like the <code>name</code>
        or <code>icons</code> is missing from the manifest, user agents can
        search in a manifest's owner [[!HTML]] document for things like icons
        and the application name (or a user agent might even fallback to
        proprietary tags/metadata, if they are present in a document).
