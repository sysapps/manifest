        This specification defines a JSON-based manifest, which provides
        developers with a centralized place to put metadata associated with a
        web application. This includes, but is not limited to, the web
        application's name, links to icons, as well as the preferred URL to
        open when the user launches the web application. The manifest also
        allows developers to declare a default orientation for their web
        application, as well as how the application is to be displayed by the
        user agent (e.g., in fullscreen).
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this meta data, user agents can provide developers with means to
        create user experiences that are more comparable to that of a native
        application.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, this specification defines the <code>manifest</code> link
        type, which provides a declarative means for a document to be
        associated with a manifest.

        Implementors need to be aware that this specification is extremely
        unstable. <strong>Implementors who are not taking part in the
        discussions will find the specification changing out from under them in
        incompatible ways.</strong> Vendors interested in implementing this
        specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation
        phase should join the aforementioned mailing lists, or <a href=

        GitHub</a>, and take part in the discussions.

        [[!ECMASCRIPT]]. Processing also relies on various algorithms defined
        in [[!HTML]], [[!FETCH]], and [[!URL]].
      </p>
      <p>
        When instructed to <dfn>Trim</dfn>(<var>x</var>), a user agent MUST
        behave as if [[!ECMASCRIPT]]'s <a href=

        As the manifest uses the JSON format, this specification relies on the
        types defined in [[!ECMA-404]] specification: namely <dfn title=
        "json-object">object</dfn>, <dfn title="json-array">array</dfn>,
        <dfn title="json-number">number</dfn>, <dfn title=
        "json-string">string</dfn>, <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, and
        <code>null</code>. Strict type checking is not enforced by this
        specification. Instead, each member's definition specifies the steps
        required to process a particular member and what to do when a type does
        not match what is expected.

      <h2>
        Display modes
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>display mode</dfn> describes the manner in which a developer
        would like the web application to be shown to a user (e.g., in
        fullscreen). Display modes are intended to correspond to the user
        interface metaphors and functionality in use on a given platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a user agent applies a particular <a>display mode</a> to a web
        application, it becomes the <dfn>default display mode</dfn> for the
        top-level document of the browsing context (i.e., it is used as the
        display mode for all top-level documents to which the window is
        navigated). Other specifications, as well as the end user, MAY override
        the <a>default display mode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a <a>display mode</a> is not supported by a user agent, its
        <dfn>fallback mode</dfn> MUST be used instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>display modes values</dfn> are as follows:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <dfn id="dm-browser">browser</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Opens the web application using the platform-specific convention for
          opening hyperlinks in the user agent (e.g., in a browser tab or a new
          window). The <code>browser</code> display mode is the <dfn>fallback
          display mode</dfn> to be used as the default if there is no valid
          <code>display</code> member in the manifest, or none of the other
          <a title="display mode">display modes</a> are supported by the user
          agent. This <a>display mode</a> MUST be supported by the user agent.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn id="dm-minimal-ui">minimal-ui</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Same as <a href="#dm-standalone">standalone</a>, but MUST provides
          the end-user with some means to access a minimal set of UI elements
          for controlling navigation (i.e., back, forward, reload, and perhaps
          some way of viewing the document's address). A user agent MAY include
          other platform specific UI elements, such as "share" and "print"
          buttons or whatever is customary on the platform and user agent.<br>
          <code>minimal-ui</code> <a>fallback mode</a> is <code>browser</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn id="dm-standalone">standalone</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Opens the web application as close as possible as a standalone
          application. The user agent SHOULD make the web application look like
          a native application on the running platform. Often, that will
          include having a different window, its own icon in the application
          switcher, etc. The web application MUST not have UI elements for
          controlling navigation, but MAY include other UI elements such as a
          status bar.<br>
          <code>standalone</code> <a>fallback mode</a> is
          <code>minimal-ui</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <dfn id="dm-fullscreen">fullscreen</dfn>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Opens the web application without any user agent chrome and takes up
          the entirety of the available display area.<br>
          <code>fullscreen</code> <a>fallback mode</a> is
          <code>standalone</code>.

        Manifest
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>manifest</dfn> is a JSON document that contains startup
        parameters and application defaults for when a web application is
        launched. A manifest consists of a top-level <a href=
        "#json-object">object</a> that contains zero or more members. Each of
        the members are defined below, as well as how their values are
        processed.

        <h3>
          Associating a resource with a manifest
        </h3>
        <p>
          A resource is said to be <dfn>associated with a manifest</dfn> if the
          resource representation, an HTML document, has a <a href=
          "#linking"><code>manifest</code> link relationship</a>, or the
          resource has a <a>well-known manifest</a>.

        <h3>
          Obtaining a manifest
        </h3>
        <p>
          A user agent can obtain a manifest either from a top-level document
          or by fetching it directly from a [[!URL]] (independently of a
          top-level document).
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent is said to have <dfn>obtained a manifest from a
          top-level document</dfn> when the manifest is associated with a
          <code>document</code> through either the <code>manifest</code> link
          type or through the <a>well-known manifest</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conversely, a user agent is said to have <dfn>obtained a manifest
          directly</dfn> when the user agent fetches the manifest independently
          of any top-level document. For example, a user agent fetches a
          manifest from a URL without first navigating to a
          <code>document</code> or the user agent makes use of the well-know
          manifest without first navigating to the web application.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h3>
          Fetching a manifest
        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>steps for fetching a manifest</dfn> are given by the
          following algorithm. It takes a URL <var>url</var> as an argument.
          This algorithm will return either a response or an error.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Let <var>response</var> be the result of <a href=

            Authors are encouraged to use the HTTP cache directives to
            explicitly cache the manifest. For example, the following response

        </h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn>steps for processing a manifest</dfn> are given by the
          following algorithm. The algorithm takes a <var>text</var> string as
          an argument, which represents a <a>manifest</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          When instructed to <dfn>issue a developer warning</dfn>, the user
          agent SHOULD report the conformance violation to the developer in a
          user-agent-specific manner (e.g., report the problem in an error
          console).
        </p>
        <p>
          When instructed to <dfn>ignore</dfn>, the user agent MUST act as if
          whatever member or value caused the condition was absent from the
          manifest document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The algorithm provides an <dfn>extension point</dfn>: other
          specifications that add new members to the manifest are encouraged to
          hook themselves into this specification at this point in the

          Updating the manifest
        </h3>
        <p>
          A user agent MAY periodically check if the contents of a manifest has
          been modified (e.g., by honoring HTTP cache directives associated
          with the manifest or by checking for updates after the web
          application has been launched). In the event that the members of the
          manifest have been updated, as determined by running the <a>steps for
          processing a manifest</a> and seeing if anything has changed, the
          user agent MAY update the metadata corresponding to the web
          application (e.g., by updating or discarding the name, icons, or
          whatever other members have been changed).
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, even if the manifest has not been modified, the user
          agents MAY periodically check if resources referenced from a manifest
          (e.g., the icons) have been modified by honoring HTTP cache
          directives. If any resources have been modified, the user agent MAY
          replace any stale resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid one application masquerading as another, it is RECOMMENDED
          that users be made aware of any such updates using implementation or
          platform specific conventions.

          Extending the manifest
        </h3>
        <p>
          This specification is designed to be extensible. Other specifications
          are encouraged to define new members for the manifest. However, in
          doing so, please follow the conventions used in this specification.
          In particular, use the <a>extension point</a> to hook into the
          <a>steps for processing a manifest</a>. Also, be sure to specify the
          steps for processing your particular member in the manner set forth
          in this specification. This will help keep this part of the platform
          consistent.
        </p>
        <p>
          When specifying an new member, don't override or <a href=
          "http://annevankesteren.nl/2014/02/monkey-patch">monkey patch</a>
          anything defined in this specification. Also, don't assume your
          member will be processed before or after any other member. Keep your
          new member, and its processing, atomic and self contained.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are writing a specification and temporarily want to patch this
          specification to help implementations along, <a href=
          "https://github.com/w3c/manifest/issues">file a bug</a> so the

          Media type registration
        </h3>
        <p>
          This section contains the required text for MIME media type
          registration with IANA.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>media type for a manifest</dfn> is
          <code>application/manifest+json</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the protocol over which the manifest is transferred supports the
          [[!MIME-TYPES]] specification (e.g. HTTP), it is RECOMMENDED that the
          manifest be labeled with the <a>media type for a manifest</a>.

            Optional parameters:

            Security considerations:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
              As the manifest format is JSON and will commonly be encoded using
              [[!UNICODE]], the security considerations described in
              [[!ECMA-404]] and [[!UNICODE-SECURITY]] apply. In addition,
              implementors need to impose their own implementation-specific
              limits on the values of otherwise unconstrained member types,
              e.g. to prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against
              running out of memory, or to work around platform-specific
              limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Web applications will generally contain ECMAScript, HTML, CSS
              files, and other media, which are executed in a sand-boxed
              environment. As such, implementors need to be aware of the
              security implications for the types they support. Specifically,
              implementors need to consider the security implications outlined
              in at least the following specifications: [[!CSS-MIME]],
              [[!ECMAScript-MIME]], [[!HTML]].
            </p>
            <p>
              As web applications can contain content that is able to
              simultaneously interact with the local device and a remote host,
              implementors need to consider the privacy implications resulting
              from exposing private information to a remote host. Mitigation
              and in-depth defensive measures are an implementation
              responsibility and not prescribed by this specification. However,
              in designing these measures, implementors are advised to enable
              user awareness of information sharing, and to provide easy access
              to interfaces that enable revocation of permissions.
            </p>
            <p>
              As this specification allows for the declaration of URLs within
              certain members of a manifest, implementors need to consider the
              security considerations discussed in the [[!URL]] specification.
              Implementations intending to display <abbr title=
              "Internationalized Resource Identifiers">IRIs</abbr> and
              <abbr title="Internationalized domain name">IDNA</abbr> addresses
              found in the manifest are strongly encouraged to follow the
              security advice given in [[!UNICODE-SECURITY]].
